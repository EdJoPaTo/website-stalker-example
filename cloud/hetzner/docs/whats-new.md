### Hetzner Goes Singapore – New location available 🇸🇬 ###

In addition to our five existing locations, Singapore is now also available!

* **Available for many products**Singapore is available for all cloud servers with AMD processors, and all cloud features.
* **First location in Southeast Asia**Singapore, a data center hub, provides exceptional network connectivity that caters to both local and overseas connections. It also expands our offer to a total of six locations in four different countries and on three continents.
* **Fair prices**This connectivity comes at a higher price for our products in Singapore compared to other locations. This also applies to charges for exceeding the included traffic limit. Of course, fair prices are still vital to us at Hetzner, and we always strive to provide attractive prices at all of our locations!

### Reworked activities page ###

The activities page has been reworked and now comes with an improved design.

* **BETTER OVERVIEW**To give you a clearer overview, the activities are now sorted by month and you can easily switch between the months as you need.
* **EASY NAVIGATION**More activities are automatically loaded as you scroll down, eliminating the need to switch between different pages and enhancing load times for a smoother user experience.
* **DOWNLOAD AS CSV**We only show activities from the past 90 days. To view all activities at any time, you can now download the activities of the selected month as CSV file.

June 2024
----------

Jun 17

### Removal of old activities ###

We are currently reworking the activities page and plan to introduce the changes at the beginning of July. From this time on, we will only show activities from the past 90 days and you will no longer be able to view activities that are older than that. If you still need your old activities, we recommend you manually save them yourself by the end of June. With the reworked activities page, you will get the new option to download the activities from the past 3 months as CSV file, which will make it easier for you in the future to save and access your activities.

Jun 06

### New shared vCPU servers with Intel® processors ###

New server plans with shared Intel® vCPUs are now available! The new servers will officially replace the current shared Intel® vCPU server plans which are now deprecated\*.

* **Four new server plans**CX22, CX32, CX42, CX52
* **Prices down, performance up!**CX22 combines the best features of the two smallest deprecated server plans as it comes with the superior performance of CX21 at the more attractive price of CX11. The other three new server plans feature twice as many vCPUs and, on top of this, more attractive prices than their predecessors!

\*To give you time to adapt the new server plans, the old server plans (CX11, CX21, CX31, CX41, CX51) will remain available for order via API until **6 September 2024**. Existing servers are not affected by this deprecation and will continue to work.

February 2024
----------

Feb 27

### Global Search: Label search now possible ###

We added the new search criterion "label" to our global search, which means you can now search resources by our [label selector query language](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#labels). In the global search bar, you can use **"ctrl / ⌘ + K"** to switch between name/IP search and label search.

**Changes regarding existing shortcuts**

Up until now, the key combination **"ctrl / ⌘ + K"** was used to open the filter within projects, and the shortcut **"/"** was used to open the project-wide global search. As **"ctrl / ⌘ + K"** is more commonly used for global searches and **"/"** is more commonly used for local searches, we decided to adjust our shortcuts for a more intuitive experience. The shortcut / now opens the filter and **"ctrl / ⌘ + K"** now opens global search.

Feb 13

### Duplicate Firewalls ###

The Firewall settings now include an option to "**duplicate**" an existing Firewall. This option allows you to create a copy of an existing Firewall, making it quick and easy to set up Firewalls with similar rules. The duplicated Firewall is not applied to any servers after it was added and you can modify the cloned rules as needed.

### Default settings for server creation ###

The "**Preferences**" modal now comes with the new tab ["**Defaults**"](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/(modal:settings/defaults)). There, you can set a server type, location, and image. When you create a new server, your preferred options are automatically preselected for you.

December 2023

### New main navigation on small screens ###

As part of our ongoing effort to improve our responsive design, we redesigned our main navigation for small screens.

* We removed the left menu bar in projects. You can now use the menu icon in the top right to switch between resource overviews.
* The user menu now comes in an improved design that makes it easier to navigate on the phone.

### CAX servers with Arm64 architecture now available in three locations ###

Up until now, server plans with Arm64 architecture were only available in Falkenstein. We are happy to announce that the CAX server plans are now also available in Nuremberg and Helsinki.

August 2023
----------

Aug 23

### New dedicated vCPU servers with AMD processors ###

New server plans with dedicated AMD vCPUs are now available! The new servers will officially replace the current dedicated AMD vCPU server plans which are now deprecated\*.

* **Great performance per price**The new servers come with the same performance as the deprecated server plans — but at far more attractive prices!
* **More Traffic**Up until now, all server plans included 20 TB of traffic by default. Depending on the plan, the new servers now come with up to 60 TB!
* **Maximum performance**Every dedicated vCPU instance has its own dedicated CPU resources. This allows them to handle high traffic and CPU-intensive tasks with ease. Additionally, the servers deliver highly predictable performance and response times.

\*To give you time to adapt the new server plans, the old server plans (CCX12, CCX22, CCX32, CCX42, CCX52, CCX62) will remain available for order until 26 September 2023. Existing servers are not affected by this deprecation and will continue to work.

Aug 07

### "Deploy to Hetzner Cloud" button ###

If you would like to link to one of our Apps, you can do it now using this new URL: "https://console.hetzner.cloud/deploy/{app-name}". When you click it, you are taken to Cloud Console and prompted to select a project. After that, you are directly forwarded to the server create page on which the App specified for "{app-name}" is automatically preselected. You can use the new link in combination with the new "Deploy to Hetzner Cloud" button, which is available in 2 different sizes. [Learn more about the button](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/apps/overview/#deploy-to-hetzner-cloud)

Jul 26

### Technical changelog now available ###

A technical changelog is now available at [docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog/). It offers an extensive overview of changes and includes announcements about our API, open-source integrations, and other relevant topics. Additionally, this page also includes an overview of all announcements from our »What's New« dialog. Next to adding the new changelogs, we also redesigned the original content at [docs.hetzner.cloud](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/). The improved design of the API docs now allows you to switch between dark and light mode.

Jul 20

### API: New endpoint for actions available ###

The Cloud API now includes the new endpoint **"GET /{resource}/actions"** for all resources that return actions in API calls. This new endpoint replaces the deprecated **"GET /actions"** endpoint and you can use it to list all actions of a specific resource (e.g. of all servers or of all Load Balancers). Starting on 1 October 2023, the **"GET /actions"** endpoint will no longer be available. After that, it won't be possible anymore to list all actions across all resources.

Also starting on 1 October 2023, all action endpoints will only return actions from the past 90 days.

June 2023
----------

Jun 23

### Networks: Expose routes to vSwitch ###

Networks with vSwitch subnets now come with a new option that allows you to use your routes not only for cloud servers but also for dedicated servers. For this, we have added "Expose routes to vSwitch" to the action menus of those networks and vSwitch subnets. As long as the routes are exposed to the vSwitch, they also become reachable for all dedicated servers that are assigned to the vSwitch.

Jun 20

### Search bar for apps ###

We updated the create page for servers to include a new search bar for apps. This way, you no longer have to look through the entire list of apps. Instead, you can just use the search bar to filter the results, making it quick and easy to find the apps you're looking for.

Jun 19

### Servers with dedicated Intel® vCPUs are deprecated ###

Starting on 18 July 2023, all server plans with Intel® vCPUs (CCX11, CCX21, CCX31, CCX41, CCX51) will no longer be available for order. Existing servers are not affected by this deprecation and they will continue to work. If you want to migrate an existing server with Intel® vCPUs to a server plan with AMD vCPUs, you can use the rescale option.

May 2023
----------

May 15

### Upcoming change regarding our API ###

Please note that there will be a change regarding the **id** fields in our API. At the moment, the **id** fields are only 32 bit wide. However, this is no longer sufficient. As a result, we will use larger IDs in future. This change will not affect IDs of existing resources.

**Starting on 1 September 2023, the first IDs will use 52-bit integers.**

**Important:**

* If you are using our API, make sure your code can handle 52-bit integers properly. Otherwise, you might run into issues.
* If you are using hcloud-go on a 32-bit platform, you will need to upgrade to a new version as the current one does not support 52 bit. Check out the official hcloud-go documentation for more information on an upcoming release.

April 2023

### New server plans with Arm64 architecture ###

In addition to the existing servers with x86-based architecture (Intel & AMD), you can now also create servers with Arm-based architecture (Ampere).

* **New CAX plans**The 4 new CAX plans all come with shared vCPUs.
* **Limited availability**At the moment, the new servers are only available in Falkenstein.
* **Great performance per price**In comparison to other servers in the same price bracket, the Arm64 architecture makes it possible to get way more compute cores.
* **High number of cores**Due to the impressive number of cores, the servers can make quick work of even the most CPU-intensive tasks.

Nov 09

### Add labels at creation process ###

The create pages for servers, Load Balancers, and Firewalls have been updated and now also include a seperate option to add labels. This way, you no longer have to add them in an extra step after the resourses were already created.

October 2022
----------

Oct 27

### New hotkey ###

Bulk edit now comes with a keyboard hotkey that allows you to deselect all resources with the press of a key. So when you are done editing, or if you want to start a new selection, simply hit esc, and your current selection will be cleared.

September 2022
----------

Sep 29

### Redesign of the server, Load Balancer, and Firewall creation pages ###

The updated design makes the creation page simpler and easy to follow. For this, a new menu sidebar on the right was built, allowing for quick and easy navigation and providing a rapid summary of your current settings. Some configuration processes have also been streamlined and simplified.

### Improved user experience for notifications ###

For an even better user experience, we have improved the behavior and design of notifications in the Cloud Console

July 2022
----------

Jul 21

### Add several labels or IPs at the same time ###

Up until now, IP addresses for firewall rules and labels had to be added one by one. Now, you can add several labels and IP addresses at the same time. Simply separate them by comma or with a space. This will make it easier for you to manage long IP lists, for example.

June 2022
----------

Jun 23

### New project overview ###

You can now also browse your projects in a list view. The new design can be helpful if you have to manage projects with very long names, for example. You can use the new toggle next to the filter on the top right to switch between both views.

Jun 22

### New Apps available ###

We have added four new Apps. You can now choose from the programming language Apps Go and Ruby, and start developing immediately after server creation. You could also use the Prometheus-Grafana installation to visualize metrics and display them graphically. Our CollaborationToolCollection App includes [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/), [transfer.sh](https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh//) and [whiteboard](https://github.com/cracker0dks/whiteboard//), and makes working on files in a team more dynamic and simple. BigBlueButton is no longer available.

Jun 08

### Flexible networking options and Primary IPs ###

You can now decide for yourself which networking option you want, and use Primary IPs to manage your server’s public IPs. Because of the new options, servers and IPs are now billed separately.

* **Choose from 3 networking options**Server with two public IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6). Server with one public IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). Server without any public IP addresses.
* **Servers without any public network**Adding the server to a private network will enable you to create the server without any public IPs and thus without a connection to a public network.
* **New flexibility with Primary IPs**After a server was created, you can still add, remove, or swap the server’s Primary IPs. To keep your Primary IP even if you delete the server it is assigned to, you can simply disable the “Auto Delete” option.

May 2022
----------

May 18

### Default SSH keys ###

With the new option to set individual SSH keys as default, you no longer have to manually select often-used SSH keys every time you create a new server. Instead, any SSH keys that have been set as default within a project will automatically be preselected for you.

May 03

### Bulk edit now available ###

Within a list view, it is now possible to select several resources at the same time and to run a certain action on all selected resources simultaneously. You can use the new multiselection to delete resources, disable/enable protection, and to power servers on or off.

March 2022
----------

Mar 07

### Session-based filter and sort settings ###

Any filter options and sort settings you set within a project now remain active for the entire session and are saved even if you switch between several list views. An automatic reset of your projects' filter settings is therefore only performed after the session was ended.

February 2022
----------

Feb 01

### Display confirmed onboarding hints again ###

Up until now, it was not possible to display hints again after confirming them. The hints draw attention to useful shortcuts and highlight helpful functionalities that can not only be helpful at the beginning. Therefore, it is now possible to display all onboarding hints again after they have already been read. You can find this option in the user menu under "Settings".

December 2021
----------

Dec 01

### Ceph server types not available anymore ###

We have deprecated the network storage based server types. Starting 1 Dec 2021, they will no longer be available. All of your existing ceph based servers will continue to work like they used to and there is no action necessary on your side regarding these servers. It is possible to rescale existing network storage based servers to local storage based servers.

### Hetzner Goes USA! - New location available ###

On 3 November, we launched our new location Ashburn, Virginia, for all cloud servers with AMD processors and all cloud features. The new U.S. location is one of the most important data center capitals in the world. Now, you can also profit from the strategic location and the global interconnectivity of the location.

October 2021
----------

Oct 13

### Placement Groups: Maximum availability for your servers ###

Our newest feature "Placement Groups" now makes it possible for you to influence the location of your cloud servers. Simply create a group of type "Spread" and all your virtual servers will be hosted on different physical servers. This will decrease the probability of some instances failing together.

September 2021
----------

### Global Search ###

Our Global Search now makes it possible for you to search resources beyond the list view and therefore across all projects based on names or IP addresses and to navigate to them with just a few clicks.

* **User-friendly keyboard navigation**The search mask opens with a click on the search bar, or by simply pressing the / key. Keyboard navigation is also integrated in the search.
* **Clear overview**All search results are grouped according to resource type to provide a clear overview. The corresponding project is specified on the right. If you search from within a certain project, the corresponding resources will be displayed as the topmost results.

Aug 17

### Load Balancers: Allow setting of DNS PTR records ###

The reverse DNS entries for the public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the Load Balancers are no longer fixed and can now be changed to look more professional. Simply select your Load Balancer and define the reverse DNS (rDNS) of each IP address under the "Networking" tab.

Aug 04

### Firewalls: Description field for rules ###

We have added a new description field per rule to make it easier for you to distinguish between individual firewall rules. Simply specify a certain purpose, for example, and use the description later to identify your rules.

July 2021
----------

Jul 19

### Load Balancer: Dedicated private IP targets ###

Next to public IPs, our Load Balancers now also support private IPs of Dedicated Root Servers (Hetzner Robot account) as targets. Simply add a network that has a subnet of type vSwitch and you will be able to define a private IP for your Dedicated Root Server within the IP range of this vSwitch subnet.

Jul 13

### New filter ###

Our search bar has been replaced with a new filter on all list views in our panel. This way, you can use new search criteria that will help you narrow down your results even further, and you will be able to find your desired resources even faster. The previous key combination Ctrl / ⌘ + K can now be used to open the fiter and, as before, to switch between label search and name search.

June 2021
----------

Jun 30

### Quickstart with apps ###

We’re constantly working on making it as easy as possible for you to set up a server. Apps allow you to create a server with software already preinstalled. This way, you no longer have to struggle with setting up a server yourself. Instead, you can get started immediately with ready to use software such as Docker, WordPress or Nextcloud.[Learn more about Apps](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/apps/overview/)

### Let's Encrypt™ support for Load Balancer services ###

We have started to support the frequently requested automatic generation of Let's Encrypt™ certificates for Load Balancers. All certificates are automatically renewed as long as they are assigned to a Load Balancer.

August 2020
----------

Aug 11

### Firewalls Beta is now available ###

* **Simple configuration**Our firewalls are "stateful" and thus allow easy configuration.
* **Easy administration**No need to manage every servers firewall independently – create your configuration once and assign it comfortably to as many of your servers as you like.
