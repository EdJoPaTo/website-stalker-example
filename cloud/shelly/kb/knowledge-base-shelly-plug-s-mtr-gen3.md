Short description
----------

Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 is one of the first of Shelly devices that come with Matter support.

Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 (The Device) is a smart plug/outlet with power measurement and overheating protection, which allows remote control of electric appliances through a mobile phone, tablet, PC, or home automation system. It can work standalone in a local Wi-Fi network or it can also be operated through cloud home automation services.

Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 can be accessed, set up and monitored remotely from any place where the User has internet connectivity, as long as the device is connected to a Wi-Fi router and the Internet.

The Device has an embedded Web Interface which can be used to monitor and control the device, as well as adjust its settings.

Main features
----------

* Matter support

* Next-generation Wi-Fi smart plug with multicolor LED indication

* Scripting (only supported when Matter is not enabled)

* Wi-Fi range extender

* BLE gateway

* Power metering

* Schedules

* Wide compatibility with 3rd party home automation systems

* Local actions

* Shelly Cloud/Shelly Smart Control app support (optional)

* Virtual Components

Use cases
----------

* **Use seamlessly and integrate together with other Matter devices**

* **Use with Apple devices (via Matter)**

* **Use it as color night light:**
  Night mode with custom settings
  When switched on, the Night mode reduces the brightness of the LED indication of your Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 during the night hours so that you can have undisturbed night sleep.

* **No more forgotten appliances on:**
  Monitor and control all plugged-in appliances easily with just a few clicks on your phone. Thanks to its integrated countdown timer and locally stored schedules, Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 can automatically switch off any forgotten device after an hour to save energy.
  Example: Iron, smaller ovens, heating electrical radiators

* **Avoid energy waste by automating your electrical appliances:**
  Automate appliances in the office that are not used at night or over the weekend by simply adding Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3. Now, you can set smart schedules that will turn off the power to all unused electrical appliances between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM during the weekdays and between 7:00 PM on Friday and 7:00 AM on Monday. That way, you will cut the energy consumption of these devices in half, which will result in significant optimization of the monthly energy cost.
  Example: Using schedules, automate smaller ovens, heating electrical radiators, IR heaters

* **Air purifier that follows the air conditions:**
  If you are living in a big city, the air can get pretty polluted, especially during the fall and winter seasons. Thanks to Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 scripting functionalities, you can extract data straight from the air pollution control and set your old air purifier at home to turn on when the air pollution levels outside increase.
  Example: Using scripting you can automate an Air purifier appliance and turn it on/off based on 3rd party data.

* **Mildly dimmed night light for children's comfort:**
  You can now set the color and the level of glow for your Shelly Plug S MTR Gen3 LED indication and use it as subtle light for the kids' room at night.
