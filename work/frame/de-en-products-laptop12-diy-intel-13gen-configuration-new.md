 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* Can I purchase in volume for my business?

  Currently, we only allow one laptop per pre-order, but there is no limit on the number of pre-orders per account. Once a configuration is in stock, you can add up to five laptops per order. If you need more or have special requests, please contact us through our [support form](%{framework_for_business_url}#contact-us) and we’ll reach out to you.

* Can I upgrade my CPU later?

  Yes! If you ever need more performance in the future, you can upgrade to a new Mainboard with a new CPU on it. We publish step by step guides you can follow to do the upgrade yourself.

* Which Processor should I choose?

  For light workloads, the i3-1315U should be sufficient. For heavier multitasking or more graphics-intensive programs, the i5-1334U may be better suited for you.

* What Wi-Fi modules are compatible?

  M.2 2230 Wi-Fi modules supporting PCIe, USB and up to WiFi 6E should work. Intel AX211 Wi-Fi 6E is tested for compatibility.

 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* What model of memory is offered in the Framework Laptop 12?

  We offer Framework-branded DDR5-5600 modules, but in Framework Laptop 12, they are only able to run at DDR5-5200 speed.

* Can I add more memory or storage later?

  Yes! The Framework Laptop 12 is fully upgradeable, so you can easily add more memory or storage at any point in the future if you need to. We sell these modules in the Framework Marketplace, but you can also pick up compatible modules elsewhere. We publish step-by-step guides you can follow to do the upgrade yourself.

* What memory is compatible?

  There is 1x DDR5 SO-DIMM slot in the Framework Laptop 12. This means you can use up to 48GB of DDR5-5200 memory. While memory that meets that standard should work, the memory we sell in the Framework Marketplace is tested for compatibility. We recommend avoiding XMP DDR5.

 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* What is an Expansion Card?

  Framework Expansion Cards allow you to customize the ports and functionality of the Framework Laptop 12. Unlike other notebooks that require adapters and dongles to get to the ports you need, you can select the ones you want at order time and change them whenever you’d like. The Framework Laptop 12 supports four simultaneous Expansion Cards, with two on each side. Expansion Cards are hot swappable; simply slide and click them into your Framework Laptop with no tools needed.

* Can I order less than four Expansion Cards?

  You can, but we don't recommend it. There are four Expansion Card slots on the Framework Laptop 12, so we suggest using one in each slot.

* Will you be adding additional Expansion Card types?

  Yes! We'll be adding new Expansion Cards over time, and we've also opened up the design to enable third parties and community members to create their own versions. We'll be making these available in the Framework Marketplace over time.

* Do I need to have a USB-C Expansion Card to charge the Framework Laptop 12?

  The Framework Laptop 12 charges over USB-C from any one of the four Expansion Card slots. We suggest configuring with at least one USB-C Expansion Card since it is difficult to directly plug into the recessed USB-C charging port inside the bay.

* Can I use any Expansion Card in any slot?

  The Framework Laptop 12 supports four simultaneous Expansion Cards, with two on each side. You can select up to four USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, DisplayPort, MicroSD, Ethernet, 1TB storage, or 250GB storage cards to fit your needs. The Framework Laptop 12 comes with a 3.5mm built-in audio jack, so you probably don't need the Audio Expansion Card.

Close

Each card can be used in any of the 4 Expansion Card slots on the Framework Laptop 12.

We suggest ordering 4 or more Expansion Cards, and that at least 1 is a USB-C Expansion Card for charging the laptop.
