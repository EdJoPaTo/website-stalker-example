Easy to fix.
----------

Framework Laptop 12 is easy to repair and upgrade, so it lasts as long as you need it to.

Hard to break.
----------

We overmolded shock-absorbing TPU over plastic with an inner metal structure to meet MIL-STD-810 durability standards.

To ensure this laptop will last, we dropped it from 48" onto plywood, pressed the power button 20,000 times, and tapped the touch screen 1,000,000 times. We also ran a bunch of other tests to ensure resistance against drops, bumps, vibrations, and at least some parts of the great outdoors.

Fits in your pocket!

Ok fine, it doesn't. But it does fit in most places you'd want a laptop—your lap, a backpack, a tiny desk, or an airplane tray.

It’s a real computer.
