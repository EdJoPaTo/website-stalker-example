A familiar, little laptop for daily needs.

Easy to fix.
----------

Framework Laptop 12 is easy to repair and upgrade, so it lasts as long as you need it to.

Hard to break.
----------

We overmolded shock-absorbing TPU over plastic with an inner metal structure to meet MIL-STD-810 durability standards.

To ensure this laptop will last we dropped it from 48” onto plywood on a steel surface, pressed the power button 20,000 times, and tapped the touch screen 1,000,000 times. We also ran a bunch of other tests to ensure resistance against drops, bumps, vibrations, and at least some parts of the great outdoors.

### Help purchase computers for Hack Club students around the world. ###

Hack Club is an awesome 501(c)(3) nonprofit that helps tens of thousands of high schoolers code and build cool things. Despite creating seriously innovative projects, some Hack Club students are coding on old, barely-functioning computers—or in some cases, just their phones. Let’s change that.

When you pre-order a Framework Laptop 12, you can choose to donate $250 USD or more to Hack Club. Your donation goes into a pool that funds Framework Laptop 12 systems for Hack Club students around the world. To celebrate doing good and helping others, we’ll move your order into Batch 0—the earliest shipping batch for your configuration.
