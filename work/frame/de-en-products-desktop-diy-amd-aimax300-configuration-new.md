 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* What is an APU?

  An APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) is a processor that integrates a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) in a single package.

* Which system should I choose?

  For moderate workloads and gaming, choose Max 385 - 32GB. For more demanding tasks, you can choose Max+ 395 - 64GB which offer better graphics and multi-threaded CPU performance. If you are planning to run AI workloads like Large Language Models, we recommend Max+ 395 - 128GB.

* Can I upgrade the memory?

  Memory is soldered to the Mainboard in these models, which makes it impossible to upgrade it afterwards. Soldered memory is a limitation of the Ryzen™ AI Max platform, but it brings substantially increased memory throughput for higher gaming and AI performance.

* What is LPDDR5X?

  LPDDR5x is a memory standard that enables high memory bandwidth with low power consumption. AMD's Ryzen™ AI Max 300 Series processors use LPDDR5x memory to enable 256GB/s of throughput. One limitation of this memory with Ryzen™ AI Max 300 Series though is that it must be soldered, which makes it non-upgradeable.

 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* How much storage is right for me?

  The amount of storage space you need depends on your use case, but 1TB is the most popular selection. If you ever need more space in the future, you can add a secondary storage drive or upgrade your primary storage drive.

* What storage drives are compatible?

  You can use M.2 2280-sized NVMe SSDs. We have drives from 250GB up to 8TB available in the Framework Marketplace. Either single-sided or double-sided 2280 SSDs can fit.

* What's the difference between all the different SSDs (SN7100, SN850X, etc)?

  SN850X is Western Digital's top-end SSD, using NVMe Gen4 to support an incredible 7,300MB/s maximum read throughput. SN7100 is a DRAM-less SSD that uses NVMe Gen4 for up to 4,000MB/s with great power efficiency. SN8000S is an OEM (non-retail) drive similar in capability to SN850X.

* Do I need to pick both primary and secondary storage?

  Your Framework Desktop can operate with a single storage drive. This can be inserted into either location. If you want more storage, you can add a secondary drive.

FAQs

**CPU Fan**

 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* How do I choose a fan?

  Framework Desktop is compatible with 120mm fans. We have two 120mm Cooler Master fan options (customized version of Cooler Master's Mobius fans with improved start-up behavior) in the configurator operating at 2400 RPM. One of them is ARGB and the other one does not have lighting. We also have a Noctua 120mm fan (NF-A12x25 HS-PWM) operating at 2400 RPM, which does not have lighting, but provides excellent performance-to-noise efficiency and comes in Noctua's infamous brown brand colors.

* Can I bring my own fan?

  You can bring your own standard 120mmx25mm fan for your Framework Desktop. If you choose the "CPU Fan Mounting Kit - 120mm (bring your own fan)" option, we will include the fan mounting kit (fan duct and 4 screws for you to install your own fan to the heatsink). We recommend using a 12V fan capable of \>100 m3/h airflow and \>3mm H2O static pressure, supporting a standard 4-pin CPU fan header.

* Do I need a fan at all?

  You need a CPU fan to dissipate the heat generated by your processor, preventing it from overheating. Without adequate cooling, your CPU will slow down and throttle substantially, potentially causing system instability. Framework Desktop is compatible with standard 120mm fans.

* What is ARGB?

  ARGB (Addressable RGB) lighting allows customization of each individual LED, offering more advanced control than standard RGB lighting, which can only display one color at a time across all LEDs. The Mainboard has a standard ARGB header and supports common ARGB control software applications.

 FAQ

FAQs
----------

* What is an Expansion Card?

  Framework Expansion Cards allow you to customize the front ports and functionality of the Framework Desktop. You can select the ones you want at order time and change them whenever you’d like. The Framework Desktop supports two Expansion Cards. Expansion Cards are hot swappable; simply unlatch, slide, and click them into your Framework Desktop with no tools needed.

* What are the dedicated ports for Framework Desktop?

  Framework Desktop has these ports in the back:
  1x HDMI - HDMI 2.1 with CEC support
  2x DisplayPort - DP 2.1 up to 10G
  2x USB-C - USB4
  1x RJ45 - 5Gbit Ethernet
  2x USB-A - USB 3.2
  1x 3.5mm Combo

* Which Expansion Cards can I use with the Framework Desktop?

  Framework Desktop Expansion Card slots support all available Expansion Cards, except HDMI and DisplayPort. You can use the Ethernet Expansion Card and the Audio Expansion Card but we have dedicated ports in the back for those as well. If you're unsure, we suggest utilizing the front slots for additional USB-C and USB-A Expansion Cards.

* Why are the Storage Expansion Cards different generations?

  1st Gen was slightly faster than 2nd Gen, but we switched due to the original flash chip being discontinued. Now that 2nd Gen's flash parts are also nearing end of life, our supplier has secured more of the original 1st Gen chips, allowing us to resume its production.

Close

Customize your ports with the Expansion Card system.

We suggest ordering at least 2 Expansion Cards. If you order fewer than 2, you will have empty slots in the front of your Framework Desktop.
