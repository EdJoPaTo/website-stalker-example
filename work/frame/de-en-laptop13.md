###### Storage ######

Never worry about running out of space. With standard M.2 SSDs, you can swap out your storage drive for high capacity ones up to a colossal 8TB.

###### Memory ######

You can upgrade your RAM whenever you need to unlock higher performance during heavy multi-tasking. Our latest generation supports up to a massive 96GB of high-speed DDR5.

###### Expansion Cards ######

External adapters are a thing of the past. The Framework Expansion Card system lets you choose exactly the ports you want and where you want them.

External adapters are a thing of the past. The Framework Expansion Card system lets you choose exactly the ports you want and where you want them.

 Designed for productivity.

 Battery

61Wh for all day battery life, long-lasting, with 80% of its capacity still available after 1,000 cycles of use.

 Screen

A 13.5” screen in a taller 3:2 aspect ratio for more efficient browsing, coding, writing, and more — now available in matte (2256x1504) and 2.8k (2880x1920, matte surface) offerings for improved visibility.

 Webcam

A \>80 degree field of view makes you look great at any angle, and 1080p image and video resolution keeps you sharp too.

 Keyboard

Comfortable and responsive with 1.5mm key travel, an adjustable backlight, and a wide range of language and layout options.

Respects your privacy.
----------

###### Privacy switches ######

Your privacy is protected at a hardware level, with physical switches that electrically cut off the webcam and microphones whenever you need.

###### No crapware ######

We hate software bloat as much as you do. Our pre-builts ship with stock Windows 11 plus the necessary drivers, and our DIY Edition lets you bring whichever operating system you’d like.

 Planet-friendly.

 The best way to reduce the environmental impact of Consumer Electronics is to make products last longer.

 Re-use

We design our laptops and every part inside to last. Our mainboard can be re-used as a standalone computer using the Cooler Master Mainboard Case or for any DIY projects.

 Refurb & Factory Seconds

We make sure no product goes unused. We refurbish returns and minimize manufacturing waste through our Factory Seconds program, lowering the price of entry too.

 Recycled materials

We’re diverting the waste stream by maximizing the use of post-consumer-recycled materials across plastics, metals, and packaging.
