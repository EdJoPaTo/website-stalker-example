**AI IN A BOX**

Framework Desktop makes massive AI models accessible to own and run locally right on your desk. With up to 96GB of memory (and even more on Linux) accessible by the Radeon™ 8060S GPU, even very large language models like OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b can run real-time.

LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp, and other tools and open source libraries work out of the box on Windows and Linux, letting you run inference on OpenAI’s gpt-oss, Meta’s Llama, Qwen3, Mistral, and other popular open LLMs. You can go beyond text too, with image generation models like Flux.

Check out our getting started guide on the basics of [running LLMs locally using LM Studio](https://frame.work/blog/using-a-framework-desktop-for-local-ai).

**NEED A CLUSTER?**

Framework Desktop has 5Gbit Ethernet along with two USB4 ports, allowing networking multiple together to run even larger models with llama.cpp RPC. With a Mini-ITX form factor, you can also pick up the Mainboard on its own and build it into your own mini-racks or standard rackmount server cases for high density.
