Discover Thread.
==========

 For a robust and reliable smart home.
----------

Thread makes your smart home more responsive and robust, and is one of the pillars of [Matter](/en/matter), the smart home standard of the future. This is why Eve is embracing Thread, offering the world’s largest portfolio of Thread-enabled devices.

###  This is Thread. ###

Thread technology is specifically developed for smart home applications to improve connectivity between devices. Now, smart home devices can communicate not only using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but also using Thread.

###  ###

The big difference with this technology is that Thread creates a mesh network. Within this, lights, thermostats, outlets, sensors, and more can also talk to each other free of the constraint of having to go through a bridge. That’s because a Thread network doesn’t need one. If a single device fails, the data packets are simply relayed to the next in the mesh. In short: The network becomes more robust with every additional Thread device. [Discover Eve accessories supporting Thread](/en/identify-your-eve-accessory)

### The benefits for you. ###

###  ###

#### No bridge ####

Thread devices don’t need a proprietary bridge to communicate with each other – they simply need a [Thread Border Router](/en/hub).

###  ###

#### Always in reach ####

If one of your devices is beyond the actual reach of your Thread Border Router, a mains-powered device placed somewhere in the middle that’s always on, such as Eve Energy, can connect it to the Thread network.

###  ###

#### Robust, self-healing network  ####

If one device in your Thread network fails, the next one fills in. Thread scales up easily and actually becomes more robust with every new device, unlike Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks which become more unreliable and challenging to manage with a high number of devices connected.

###  ###

#### Ultra-responsive  ####

Thread was designed specifically to enable both mains-powered and battery-operated devices to be extremely responsive regardless of network size and density.

###  ###

#### Longer battery life ####

Batteries last much longer thanks to Thread’s extremely low power consumption.

###  ###

#### Future-proof  ####

Thread is a pillar of the new smart home standard [Matter](/en/matter). All Thread-enabled Eve devices will receive free firmware updates over time – so if you purchase a Thread-enabled Eve device today, you're already prepared for Matter.

###  Introducing Matter. ###

Designed around interoperability and platform independence, making it easy to control your smart home devices securely from any smartphone or voice assistant you choose: The future of the smart home is called Matter, and that future is now. The first Matter-enabled Eve devices are now available!

If you have purchased a Thread-enabled Eve device in the past, and want to leverage Matter to use your Eve devices from an additional platform, you're now eligible for a free firmware upgrade.

###  Good to know ###

 These Eve accessories support Thread

All current Eve devices that support Bluetooth also support Thread, including [Eve Aqua](/en/eve-aqua), [Eve Door & Window](/en/eve-door-window), [Eve Energy](/en/eve-energy), [Eve Flare](/en/eve-flare), [Eve Light Switch](/en/eve-light-switch), [Eve Motion](/en/eve-motion), [Eve MotionBlinds](/en/eve-motionblinds), [Eve Room](/en/eve-room), [Eve Shutter-Switch](/en/eve-shutter-switch), [Eve Thermo](/en/eve-thermo), [Eve Water Guard](/en/eve-water-guard) and [Eve Weather](/en/eve-weather). If you already own an Eve device, [discover here](en/identify-your-eve-accessory) if it already supports Thread.

 These Thread accessories can route data packets in a Thread network

Mains-powered Thread devices that are always on, such as [Eve Energy](/en/eve-energy), [Eve Light Switch](/en/eve-light-switch), [Eve Shutter Switch](/en/eve-shutter-switch) or [Eve Water Guard](/en/eve-water-guard), can act as router nodes within your Thread network and relay data packets. So, the more of these Full Thread Devices (FTDs) you have in your network, the more stable and greater its reach becomes. By contrast, battery-operated Thread devices, such as [Eve Aqua](/en/eve-aqua), [Eve Door & Window,](/en/eve-door-window) [Eve Flare](/en/eve-flare), [Eve Motion](/en/eve-motion), [Eve MotionBlinds](/en/eve-motionblinds), [Eve Room](/en/eve-room), [Eve Thermo](/en/eve-thermo) and [Eve Weather](/en/eve-weather) represent endpoints in the Thread network (or Minimal Thread Devices – MTDs).

 Viewing your thread network structure in the Eve app

To view the structure of your Thread network and see where you can make improvements, simply go to the Settings area of the Eve app and tap Thread Network. Among other things, you’ll be able to tell which nodes your Thread devices use to communicate and whether you can further optimize the stability and reach of your network and devices by adding one more Eve Energy or moving one to a better location.
