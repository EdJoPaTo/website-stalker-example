Welcome, Matter!

==========

### The future of smart home has arrived. ###

Matter is here – and the first Eve devices are ready to be used with the new standard for smart home devices!

Designed around interoperability and platform independence, making it easy to control your smart home devices securely from any platform you choose: the future of smart home is called Matter, and that future is now.

###  Made for everyone in your home. ###

Matter-enabled devices are a breeze to integrate into your smart home. Your entire family can control your home through their preferred voice assistant or app. That’s because Matter doesn’t mind if you use an iPhone, Android device or call upon Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant.

###

 Cutting-edge connectivity. ###

Matter devices truly shine when they talk via Thread. This groundbreaking network technology makes your smart home more responsive, robust, and increases its reach. That is why all [Eve devices embrace Thread](/en/thread).

###  These Eve devices come with Matter compatibility. ###

### Getting started with your new Eve device. ###

Adding Eve devices with a Matter logo to your smart home is fast and easy.

Watch the video

###  Getting started. ###

First, add a hub to your home that supports both Thread and Matter. To [choose the perfect hub](/en/hub), decide which platform you want to use to control your smart home devices.

[Which hub is right for me?](/en/hub)

Now you can easily add your Eve device to your smart home in just a few steps using the app of your favorite platform. On selected platforms, your voice assistant will also offer its help.

And that's it – now you can access your Eve device via your chosen platform.

If you want to connect your Eve device to an additional platform, you need a hub of that platform as well. This hub only needs to support Matter – as Thread is already present in your home. [How to add a second platform](/en/addplatform).

[Learn more](/en/hub)

###  Upgrade your existing Eve devices to Matter. ###

If you have purchased a [Thread-enabled Eve device](https://www.evehome.com/identify-your-eve-accessory)in the past, and want to leverage Matter to use your Eve devices from an additional platform, you're eligible for a free firmware upgrade. Upgrades are now available for theseThread-enabled Eve devices:

* Eve Energy (Australia, Europe, U.K., U.S. & Canada)
* Eve Door & Window
* Eve Light Switch (U.S. & Canada)
* Eve Motion
* Eve MotionBlinds for Roller Blinds
* Eve Shutter Switch
* Eve Thermo
* Eve Weather

[How to upgrade](/en/upgrade-to-matter)

### Privacy & Security ###

Matter is designed to work entirely locally without a cloud, and so is Eve. Eve will never access, store, or process your personal data and there is no Eve cloud or bridge, so you can always rely on being covered by the privacy frameworks set and enforced by the platform of your choice. Read here on how the individual platforms value your privacy.

[Apple](https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) [SmartThings](https://eula.samsungiotcloud.com/legal/us/en/pps.html) [Google Home](https://safety.google/nest/) [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230)

 What has Thread got to do with Matter?

Apart from unpractical bridges, there are two direct connection technologies that your smart home accessories can use to support Matter: Wi-Fi and Thread. Thread offers several advantages over Wi-Fi, including robust mesh technology and incredible energy efficiency. [Learn more about the advantages of Thread here.](/thread)

 Will Eve devices with Wi-Fi technology also support Matter?

While all Thread-enabled Eve devices are ready to be updated to Matter, Eve devices with Wi-Fi technology will continue to be available exclusively with HomeKit integration.

 What’s the difference between HomeKit and Matter?

Matter is a new smart home protocol developed jointly by Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung and many other manufacturers to eliminate incompatibilities in the smart home once and for all. The protocol incorporates many benefits of HomeKit, including an ultra-secure and completely local infrastructure – all without the need for an internet connection. If HomeKit impressed you, you'll be thrilled about Matter.

 What’s going to happen with my HomeKit accessories?

Any HomeKit accessories you own will continue to work as usual. You’ll be able to use them in the Home and Eve apps without any restrictions – Matter-enabled devices will simply join them on an equal footing with HomeKit accessories. If you’re already using Thread-enabled Eve devices, [free firmware updates](/en/upgrade-to-matter) will be made available over time to seamlessly upgrade them to Matter. You’ll then be able to use those devices not only with HomeKit, but also with other platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings.
