### The cirrus nimbus is extremely energy-efficient thanks to an Intel® CPU with intelligent power-saving functions and an integrated UHD graphics unit.  ###

### completely silent due to fanless cooling ###

The housing is the heat sink. Several layers of solid aluminum with copper cores form several cooling fins and reliably dissipate the waste heat from the CPU to the environment. The cirrus nimbus v5 impresses not only by its exceptional and compact design, but can convince in particular by its cooling performance.

### Powerful and Energy-saving ###

The cirrus nimbus is extremely modest in terms of power consumption thanks to an Intel® CPU with intelligent power-saving functions and an integrated UHD graphics unit. With the choice of three different mainboards, the cirrus 7 nimbus v5 can be configured for many different purposes from office to industry.

Aluminium Cooling Fins

The cirrus nimbus has a modular structure. The heart of the cooling system is a solid aluminum block with six copper cores, which sits directly on the CPU. The number of cooling fins is variable. With more cooling fins, depending on the application, a higher cooling capacity can be achieved. By default, we offer the cirrus nimbus in three variants. The Standard Cooling Edition, the Extended-Cooling Edition (with 5 additional cooling layers) and the Extreme Cooling Edition (with 9 additional cooling layers). While the Standard Cooling Edition provides sufficient cooling performance for most desktop use cases, the Extended Cooling Edition is designed for ambitious users with high workload and 24/7 operation. With the Extreme-Cooling Edition, the CPU can also be cooled under continuous full load.
