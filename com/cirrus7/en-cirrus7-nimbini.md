cirrus7 nimbini - the little one with size
----------

At just 157x157x81mm, the cirrus nimbini v2 is the smallest scion of the cirrus - mini-PC family. Made from the model of its big brother, the cirrus7 nimbus, it has no fans at all and is constructed from modular aluminum layers with copper cores that ensure passive operation even under full load. The modular design allows a variety of different models for a variety of applications.

### cirrus nimbini v4 - Pro Edition ###

The new Pro Edition v4 is equipped with a current Intel® Xe. With 2x HDMI 2.0b, 3x USB--A 3.1 (10Gb/s), 1x USB-A 2.0 (480Mb/s), 2x Thunderbolt 4, 1x 2.5GBase-T and IR receiver, the Pro Edition is suitable for both playback of media content as well as a quiet mini workstation at work. From the i5 CPU, the Pro Edition already has 4 CPU cores including Hyperthreading. The massive passive cooling including 5 copper cores also ensures better cooling than the air-cooled Intel NUC version.

### cirrus nimbini v2 - Gemini Edition ###

Equipped with an Intel® Gemini Lake dual or quad-core CPU, this nimbini model provides solid desktop performance. Of course, like all our cirrus 7 nimbini v2 models, it is completely fanless and silent. With 2xHDMI 2.0a, 2x 4K monitors can be operated at 60Hz even with this entry-level model.
