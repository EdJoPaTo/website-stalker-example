[configure now](https://www.cirrus7.com/produkte/cirrus7-incus/)

The all-rounder with AMD Ryzen APU. Thanks to AMD Vega graphics, this passively cooled system is suitable even for advanced 3D games.

### completely silent due to fanless cooling ###

The housing is the heat sink. Several layers of solid aluminum with copper cores form several cooling fins and reliably dissipate the waste heat from the CPU to the environment. Just like the other cirrus passive cooling pc series, incus impresses not only by its exceptional and compact design, but remarkable as well in particular by its performance.

### Innovative and Modular ###

cirrus incus has a modular structure. The heart of the cooling is a massive aluminum block with six copper cores, which sits directly on the CPU. The number of cooling fins is variable. Depending on the application, a higher cooling capacity can be achieved with more cooling fins.

### AMD Ryzen desktop processors with integrated Radeon graphics ###

Uncompromising performance can now finally be experienced fanless and silent. Suitable not only for the office but also for gamers and artists.
