About Us

Sustainability and
impact does not have to be boring, it can be beautiful too-with inuru
==========

Towards a circular economy.
==========

Landfills are exploding. Humanity uses twice as many resources as earth can regenerate. We build a future where no tree has to be cut down, no material mined, no thing shipped around the world just to be thrown away after one use. This is insanity. We help to end it by helping people change.

Vision

The future is shared.
==========

In the future packaging will not be thrown away but shared. Multi-purpose & multi-life cycle through dynamic surfaces that change in real time and on demand. And yes - it is sooo cyber!

One use convenience
with multi-use products.
==========

Consumer packaged goods are convenient. Also they are one-use only.Today we mine, ship and process materials just to burn them after on use. Only 15% of materials are recycled - rest goes into landfill. The reason is packaging. It makes products distinguishable.It also makes re-use impossible. Because each and every product would need to be sent back to it's origin to be refilled. Instead Inuru uses one bottle or container with a display. So the surface is not static and can be changed to display any brand on demand. One bottle can be shared among many supply chains. No need to go back to its origin. Saving 99% materials or waste. 67% energy or CO2. Eliminating the single use product manufacturer. Using existing supply chains to wash and re-distribute.
