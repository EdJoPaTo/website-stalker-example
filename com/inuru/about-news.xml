			OLED Fashion: What It Is, How It Feels, and Why Wearing Light Changes the Way We’re Seen
		</h1>
		<p>
			OLED fashion is clothing and accessories that integrate organic light-emitting diode panels. Unlike point-like LEDs, OLEDs are ultra-thin, flexible, and printable area lights, so garments can glow softly, show logos or animations, and switch modes for day-to-night visibility, artistic expression, and interactive storytelling.

			What Is OLED? Definition, Technology & the Future of Printed OLEDs (2025 Guide)
		</h1>
		<p>
			OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) is a thin, energy-efficient light source made of organic semiconductor layers that emit light when electricity passes through. Unlike LEDs, OLEDs need no backlight, enabling ultra-thin, flexible, and printable surfaces used in smartphones, TVs, wearables, safety gear, medical devices, and smart packaging.

			High Visibility Wearables: Protecting Kids, Runners, and Everyday Commuters with OLED Technology
		</h1>
		<p>
			High visibility wearables are clothing and accessories that make people more visible in low light. They use reflective strips, LEDs, or OLED panels to actively emit light. This improves safety for workers, runners, cyclists, and children, reducing accident risks on roads and in dark environments.
