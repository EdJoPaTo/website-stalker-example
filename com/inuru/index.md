WE PRINT LIGHT.
==========

Sustainable OLED seamlessly
integrated into everyday things..

We simplified OLED to bring lighting anywhere it matters.
==========

OLED is a lighting and display technology, that is paper-thin and recyclable. It could be integrated everywhere. But until today OLED was too expensive.

We simplified the production of OLED through printing, making it not only affordable but revolutionary. Changing branding, medication and clothing.

Our vision is to bring OLED technology to the level of maturity, that low-cost displays can replace static surfaces of packaging and clothing.

Towards a society without waste.
