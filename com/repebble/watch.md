[NEWPebble Round 2! Read the announcement](/blog/pebble-round-2-the-most-stylish-pebble-ever)

My new company (Core Devices) and I are proud to introduce new watches that closely follow the original Pebble DNA. If you had a Pebble and loved it, or missed your chance 10 years ago but heard about it since, we think you will really enjoy these new devices.

For those unfamiliar with Pebble, it's an e-paper smartwatch with simple functionality, long battery life and a fun, quirky design. It first launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android/) in 2012.

FAQ
----------

### How do I pick my color? ###

Before we ship your watch, you'll be able to select from available color options ([Time 2 options](/watch/pt2-color-options), [Round 2 options](/images/products/pr2-color-options.png)) and add accessories like extra watch straps and chargers.

You don't need to choose your color now - we'll contact you before shipping to confirm your color preference.

### Is there a warranty? ###

Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective watch, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. See our full [warranty](/warranty).

Otherwise, you generally should already know what you're getting into. You're getting an awesome smartwatch running PebbleOS. There are many [videos](https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebbleos-is-awesome) and [reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQh1b_srGM4) of PebbleOS you can check out before pre-ordering.

### How does shipping to countries outside the US work? ###

All prices are in USD.

All shipments are sent from our warehouse in Asia via courier with tracking. This means that non-US shipments will not be subjected to US tariffs. Your country may have its own taxes, tariffs, customs or duties fees. Shipments are sent 'DDP' which means that all taxes, tariffs and duties are prepaid. We'll contact you when your watch is ready to confirm your address and request any necessary payments.

### What if the US tariff situation changes? ###

Currently, US customs charges a tariff of approximately $10 per watch. Only US customers will be charged this tariff. If the tariff amount changes, we will email you before shipping to confirm your order - you will have the option to cancel your pre-order and get a full refund (minus credit card transaction fees).

### Can I email/tweet/DM and try to convince you to add X/Y/Z feature? ###

Sure. Feedback is always appreciated, but we're not planning to make any changes to the hardware at this point. Also, it's highly likely that we've already considered the feature in question and decided not to include it. Designing a smartwatch is an exercise in taste and constraint maximization.

Here's the awesome part - PebbleOS is [open source](https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos)! You don't need our permission to add new software features. You can modify the OS and run those changes on your watch. If you're hardware inclined, you can even build your own watch (with different features or capabilities) and run PebbleOS on it.
