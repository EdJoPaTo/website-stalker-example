**Pebble is back!**

After 9 years in stasis, we're back. Why? Because no one has created a smartwatch that fits our specific set of needs: **always-on e-paper screen**, **long battery life**, **simple and beautiful user experience**, **buttons**, and **easy to customize**! Read the [manifesto](https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back).

**Our goal is simple**: build awesome smartwatches and other gadgets, for ourselves and like-minded folks. Things are different this time round. There are no investors. The majority of our work is open source. We're not trying to take over the world. We just dream up new devices that we'd like to use and build them.
