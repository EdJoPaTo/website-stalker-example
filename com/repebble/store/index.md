Get your new PebbleOS watch
==========

My new company (Core Devices) and I are proud to introduce two new watches that closely follow the original Pebble DNA. If you had a Pebble and loved it, or missed your chance 10 years ago but heard about it since, we think you will really enjoy these new devices.

For those unfamiliar with Pebble, it's an e-paper smartwatch with simple functionality, long battery life and a fun, quirky design. It first launched on Kickstarter in 2012. The company was sold in 2016 to Fitbit. In January 2025, Google graciously open sourced [PebbleOS](https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware), enabling anyone to build upon the amazing Pebble software foundation.

FAQ
----------

### Is this a Kickstarter? ###

No. I have personally funded development of these new watches because…I really want them myself! If you place an pre-order, you can cancel it at any time for a full refund (minus credit card transaction fees, for pre-orders placed after March 21, 2025), up until your watch is ready to ship. As we get closer to shipping, we will share more details, images and information. If you decide at any point that the watch is not for you, you can [cancel your pre-order](/manage) any time before your watch ships.

### Is Core 2 Duo basically an upgraded Pebble 2? ###

Yes! The big change is an increase from 7 to 30 days of battery life. We also added a speaker, linear actuator motor, compass and barometer, and improved the buttons. Read the [announcement post](https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches) for more info.

### Is Core Time 2 basically an upgraded Pebble Time 2? ###

Yes! It features the exact same beautiful screen as Pebble Time 2. We've added a speaker and touch screen, and boosted battery life. The industrial design is also slightly different. It looks more like a Core 2 Duo because the top glass is flat rather than curved. Read the [announcement post](https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches) for more info.

### Can I choose the color of my Core Time 2? \* ###

Yes! Before we ship your Core Time 2, you'll be able to select from available color options. We will definitely offer a black option and a stainless steel option. We may announce additional color options later as we get closer to shipping.

You don't need to choose your color now - we'll contact you before shipping to confirm your color preference.

### Is there a warranty? ###

Yes, we warrant against manufacturing defects for 30 days after you receive your order. Ship us the defective watch, and after we receive it back, we will ship (no charge) you a replacement. Full legalese warranty will be posted later.

Otherwise, you generally should already know what you're getting into. You're getting an awesome smartwatch running PebbleOS. There are many [videos](https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebbleos-is-awesome) and [reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQh1b_srGM4) of PebbleOS you can check out before pre-ordering.

### How does shipping to countries outside the US work? ###

All prices are in USD.

All international shipments will be sent via courier (DHL, Fedex, UPS) with tracking. Be prepared - your country will likely charge you taxes, customs and duties fees. Please do not email us to complain about this or ask for changes to the shipping method. Also, we are unable to sell or ship to Russia, North Korea, Iran, or Cuba due to US export restrictions.

### What if the tariff situation changes? ###

It's highly likely that worldwide tariffs will change between now and when we start shipping. If tariffs change dramatically, we will pass these costs along to you and require further payment, even for US orders. If this occurs, we will email you before shipping to confirm your order - you will have the option to cancel your pre-order and get a full refund (minus credit card transaction fees, for pre-orders placed after March 21, 2025).

### Can I email/tweet/DM and try to convince you to add X/Y/Z feature? ###

Sure. Feedback is always appreciated, but we're not planning to make any changes to the hardware at this point. Also, it's highly likely that we've already considered the feature in question and decided not to include it. Designing a smartwatch is an exercise in taste and constraint maximization.

Here's the awesome part - PebbleOS is [open source](https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware)! You don't need our permission to add new software features. You can modify the OS and run those changes on your watch. If you're hardware inclined, you can even build your own watch (with different features or capabilities) and run PebbleOS on it.
