 WHICH CLOUD SERVER SHOULD I USE?
----------

### Dedicated vCPU ###

These dedicated plans have low latencies and are suitable for sustained high CPU and network use, making them ideal for business critical applications and production-ready use cases with high workloads. Use these plans for high-traffic websites and applications, gaming servers, machine learning, and big data processing. With our CCX plans, dedicated vCPUs are cheaper than ever!

It's time to take the next step and get your very own dedicated cloud instance to optimize your workload.

### Shared vCPU ###

In our shared vCPU plans, you share the hardware resources with "neighbors", so your apps are affected by how much neighbors use the vCPU, which can mean changing response times. Shared vCPU plans have the best price-performance ratio. They are suitable for development and production environments with medium levels of traffic and computing power demand.

Use these shared instances for development and test applications with low to medium levels of resource requirements and network traffic. They are ideally suited for small databases, micro services, content management systems or webservers with low to medium traffic.

### GDPR-compliant ###

All our cloud plans and other hosting offers are GDPR-compliant and comply with the strictest European data protection standards. This also applies to our locations in the USA and Singapore.

----------

[](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/load-balancer/)

### Load Balancer ###

Load Balancers let you scale your applications easily by automatically distributing traffic across your infrastructure. Handle common use-cases like TLS termination or create an internet-facing entry point to route traffic into your Hetzner Cloud Networks.

### Primary IPs ###

Assign Primary IPs to your server to establish a connection to the internet. Or create a private-network-only cloud server by not adding any Primary IPs at all. You can change the selected network option at any time.

### Networks ###

Let your servers communicate through a private network and setup complex network topologies. Ideal for running a Kubernetes cluster or a database server that should not be reachable publicly.

### Firewalls ###

Our stateful Firewalls make it easy to secure your infrastructure at no additional cost. Define inbound and outbound rules to deny any unwanted traffic. Once configured, you can assign them to as many of your cloud servers as you like.

### Volumes ###

Volumes offer highly available and reliable SSD storage for your cloud servers. You can expand each Volume to up to 10 TB at any time and you can connect them to your Hetzner cloud servers.

Frequently Asked Questions
----------

* **How do you bill your servers?**

  Servers have both a monthly price cap and a price per hour. Your server's bill will never exceed its monthly price cap. If you delete your Cloud Server before the end of the billing month, you will only be billed the hourly rate. We will bill you for each cloud server until you choose to delete them. Even if you aren't actively using your server, we will bill you for it.

* **Do you bill servers that are off?**

  Yes. All servers that have finished their creation process will be billed until they are deleted, regardless of their state.

  This is because, internally, we allocate full resources to servers regardless of their power state. And it enables rapid startup and boot times for you, the customer.

* **Is there any way to get a custom configuration?**

  Customized virtual servers (additional RAM, additional/larger drives etc.) are not currently available.

* **How reliable are local storage disks for servers?**

  Servers with local storage keep all data on a local RAID10 on the host system. This provides fault-tolerance in case of hardware defects. They are optimized for high I/O performance and low latency and are especially suited for applications which require fast access to disks with low latency, such as databases.

* **Can I install Windows?**

  Right now we are focusing on support for Linux as an operating system. If you wish, you may install Windows on your own, and we have seen successful installations done. However, we will not provide any support for Windows.

* **Do you plan to add x feature?/Will you add more features?**

  We want to keep adding new features and services and are always interested in hearing from you on how we can improve our product! There are several ways you can provide us with product feedback or feature requests:

  * Via our forum: please post your request in the [Hetzner Cloud Board](https://forum.hetzner.com/index.php?board/117-hetzner-cloud/)
  * Via email: send us your ideas to [cloud-feedback@hetzner.com](mailto:cloud-feedback@hetzner.com).

  Unfortunately, we cannot give you a detailed roadmap of what we are working on. However, you can keep up to date by following us on our social media channels.

* **Will you add additional locations in different geographic regions?**

  We have continuously expanded our cloud locations in recent years. In addition to Germany and Finland, we now also have international locations in Ashburn, Virginia; Hillsboro, Oregon (USA) and Singapore. We are constantly examining possible future locations. If you don’t want to miss the opening of a new location, subscribe to our [newsletter](https://www.hetzner.com/newsroom/newsletter/) or follow us on our social media channels.

* **Is there a library to access Hetzner Cloud from my programming language?**

  We currently maintain official open source libraries for [Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go) and [Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python).

  You can find libraries for other languages created by the community in our [Awesome Hetzner Cloud List](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud#libraries). You are also welcome to develop something yourself! Take a look at our API documentation at [docs.hetzner.cloud](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/).

* **What are the Hetzner Cloud Volumes?**

  It is a feature for fast, flexible, and cost-effective (SSD based) block storage which you can attach to your Hetzner Cloud Server.

* **How does Hetzner Online store the data in Volumes?**

  Every block of data is stored on three different physical servers (triple replication).

* **How many servers can I create?**

  Each customer has a default limit for the number of Cloud resources that we simultaneously provide. If you would like to increase your limit, you can send a request to our support team by opening a support ticket via Cloud Console. Our team will quickly review your request and, if everything is in order, they will increase your limit.
