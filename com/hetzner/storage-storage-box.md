Frequently Asked Questions
----------

* **How does Hetzner Online secure data on Storage Boxes?**

  Your files on Storage Boxes are safeguarded with a RAID configuration which can withstand several drive failures. Therefore, there is a relatively small chance of data being lost. The data is not mirrored onto other servers. In addition, checksums for the individual data blocks are used to detect and correct bit errors.

* **Can I give other people access to my Storage Box?**

  You can create additional users for your Storage Box via the Hetzner Console administration interface. They can use the same protocols as the main user. Other users have access only to a designated subdirectory of the main user. However, the main user has full access to the directories of all sub-accounts.
