Features
----------

### Traffic ###

Storage Shares have unlimited internal and external traffic, so you'll have no problem uploading and downloading all your data to and from your Storage Share.

### Backups ###

You can rest assured that your data is safe. Hetzner's RAID-based storage backend and our cluster network of databases make the probability of failure very low. In addition, Hetzner's system automatically makes backups of the database and storage backend several times every day.

### Sharing ###

Use Storage Share with an unlimited number of users and summarise them in user groups. Easily share documents within the team or with other Storage Share or Nextcloud instances.

### Flexible access ###

Our Storage Shares include a user-friendly web interface. Users always connect to it via HTTPS. Or you can use the Nextcloud apps for iOS and Android, or the desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux to access your Storage Share. And WebDAV lets you automate your access to it.

### Customizable ###

It's easy to customize your Storage Shares with apps available in the Nextcloud Appstore to meet your specific needs. For example, you can integrate your own authentication systems. Additional apps must be carried out independently, we cannot offer support for this.

### Scalability ###

Stay flexible with your Storage Share. Regardless of how your requirements change over time, you can upgrade or downgrade your Storage Share in a few quick steps and without worrying about data loss. Simply switch between the Storage Share package size you need by going to your account on the konsoleH, and then to "Account type".

The setup for Storage Shares is a snap using either the app or the web front end. And the synchronization client will enable you to automatically synchronize your files from local devices with your Storage Share.

Our team of technicians takes care of the administration of your Storage Shares for you. Our highly optimized and automated systems monitor them around the clock and install the latest updates.

Frequently asked questions
----------

* **How do we keep your data secure with Storage Share?**

  The Storage Share file system can tolerate several simultaneous drive failures. As soon as we detect any irregularies with our drives, we will exchange them immediately, thereby further decreasing the chance of failure to a very low level.

  In addition, our Storage Share file system checks the integrity of the data using checksums and automatically corrects errors. We've created high-availability cluster for the instance databases, making the chances of a complete failure very minimal. A backup is also performed automatically several times a day. Finally, if you choose to synchronize your Storage Share data with your own computer or device using client software, you will have an additional copy of your data.

* **How can I create backups?**

  A backup is performed automatically several times a day. The backup is always made to another host machine on which the instance is not running. If completed it is possible to restore a backup via konsoleH.

* **What does the "unlimited" storage quota setting mean?**

  An administrator can create users and limit their storage size. So you as an administrator, can set up storage space for your users that are, for example 5, 10, 50, or 100 GB. Or you can set up an "unlimited" sized space. However, this "unlimited" space will actually be limited by the overall storage quota size of the Storage Share instance that you (the admin) have bought.

* **Can I use Storage Share with my smartphone?**

  Yes, there is a Nextcloud app for iOS and Android that is also compatible for Storage Share. You can download the apps at the following links.
  Android: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client>
  iOS: <https://itunes.apple.com/app/nextcloud/id1125420102?mt=8>

  After starting the app of your choice, enter the server address. Then log in with your Storage Share user details.

* **Can I share my data with another user on a different server?**

  Yes, you can share data between different servers using your Federated Cloud ID. You can find this Federated Cloud ID by clicking on your profile picture, going to "Settings" and then clicking on "Sharing". You will then see your Federated Cloud ID on the right-hand side. After this, you can open the share menu of the file you want to share, and on the line "Name, Federated Cloud ID or email address...". You can then enter the entire Federated Cloud ID. An example address will have a format that looks like this: "Admin@nx\*\*\*\*.your-storageshare.de".

* **Can I use domains besides "nx\*.your-storageshare.de"?**

  Yes, you can activate a subdomain on your konsoleH account. Before you do that, though, you will need your own domain and you will need to set CNAME records for it in the DNS. After that, choose the correct Storage Share instance, then click on the menu tabs "Settings; Configuration; Subdomains" on the left. You can now enter your subdomain. Find detailed instructions in [Hetzner Docs](https://docs.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share/configuration/subdomain).

* **Can Hetzner add the feature "x"?**

  Unfortunately, we at Hetzner Online cannot add any features to Storage Share since we have not developed this software ourselves. Storage Share is based on the open source software from Nextcloud. However, you can make a feature request by going to the official Github repository: <https://github.com/nextcloud/server/>
