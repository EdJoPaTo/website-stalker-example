					Servers
				</h2>
				<p>
					Cloud servers are virtual machines that run on physical servers and are used to run an operating system and computer programs. The physical servers are located in the USA, in Singapore, and in our data centers in Europe. The virtualization makes it possible for you to adjust the scale of your servers at any time. And you can easily add or remove other features if needed. Our cloud servers do not include public IP addresses but you can add Primary IPs if you would like to have a public network interface. You can choose to use existing Primary IPs (IPv4, IPv6) from your project or to create a new one with the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can create your own cloud server quickly and easily in the
					<a href="https://console.hetzner.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						Hetzner Console
					</a>
					and add features such as Firewalls and Volumes. You also have the option to create a new server from a snapshot.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Pricing
				</h2>
				<p>
					Cloud server prices vary depending on the  (Shared Resources, Dedicated Resources) and do not include public IP addresses. Per server, you can add one Primary IP of each type (IPv4, IPv6), see .

					Network options
				</h2>
				<p>
					Cloud servers do not include public IP addresses. Therefore, a

						Primary IP
					</a>
					has to be added to the server to establish a connection to the internet.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							We do not charge for our Primary IPs of type IPv6.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							We charge an additional cost of
							<strong>
								€ 0.50/month (excl. VAT)
							</strong>
							for our Primary IPs of type IPv4.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When creating a server, you can choose from three network options. At least one of those three options has to be selected.

				<p>
					If you create a server with a public IP address and do not select an existing Primary IP from your project, our system will auto-create one for you.

				<p>
					<strong>
						Please note:
					</strong>
					Each interface of a cloud server is automatically assigned a MAC address and connections to the internet only work with this assigned MAC address.
