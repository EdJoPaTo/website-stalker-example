				<h2>
					Can I access your service using an API?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Of course! You can find our API documentation at
					<a href="https://docs.hetzner.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						docs.hetzner.cloud
					</a>
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you used our API to develop something, we would appreciate your feedback. Please let us know about it by writing a support request using your Hetzner Console account.
				</p>
				<h2>
					How are API tokens stored?
				</h2>
				<p>
					In order to access our API, you will need to generate an API token, which is a 64 byte string. The last 32 bytes of this key are secret. The first 32 bytes are a prefix which is used for identification, similar to a username. When the token is created, we will display the full version only once.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, your token cannot be retrieved in full again since the secret portion is only stored in a hashed format. The prefix can be retrieved again to identify the token, for example, in the list of account activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The prefix part itself does not enable access to the API since the secret part is needed as well.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Do you sponsor efforts to integrate Hetzner Cloud into Open Source libs?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Yes, we do! If you are developing integrations based on our API, and your product is Open Source, you may be eligible for a free one time € 50 / $ 50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us by writing a support request from your Hetzner Console account, and let us know the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The type of integration you would like to develop
					</li>
					<li>
						The link to the GitHub repo you will use for the project
					</li>
					<li>
						Link(s) to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can find a list of integrations that are already done or are being worked on here:

				<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					We'd love to hear from you! :)
				</p>
				<h2>
					Is there a command line (CLI) tool to access Hetzner Cloud?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Yes. We provide it as an Open Source project here:
					<a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to contribute or extend it, please do so by opening pull requests.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Is there a library that lets me access Hetzner Cloud using my programming language?
				</h2>
				<p>
					We currently provide Open Source libraries for
					<a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						Go
					</a>
					and
					<a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						Python
					</a>
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can find unofficial libraries for many languages at our integrations list:
					<a href="https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Since our API is very easy to use, you may not even need a full lib — a quick HTTPS request may be enough. Check out our API documentation at
					<a href="https://docs.hetzner.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						docs.hetzner.cloud
					</a>
