        ###  Object Storage is the S3-compatible storage solution that grows with your data requirements – secure, flexible and accessible via API.  ###

        Whether for backups, multimedia or big data, Object Storage offers the ideal solution for managing data-intensive workloads. In contrast to conventional storage solutions, data is organized as objects consisting of the data itself, the metadata and a unique ID. This structure makes it easy to manage the data, search through it and organize it, and is particularly suitable for large, unstructured amounts of data.

I waited a very long time for S3-compatible object storage so that we could also move this part of our infrastructure to Hetzner. Everything works without any problems. Thanks to the whole team for their good work.

I am fully satisfied with the product. I use it to automatically back up various shares of my Synology NAS via HyperBackup. It’s great that I no longer have to rely on other providers for this, but can now also book S3 storage with Hetzner.

###  Backup and restore  ###

Object Storage integrates seamlessly with backup software. The ability to lock objects ensures that all stored data remains in its original state. Data cannot be deleted and is not susceptible to ransomware attacks. Backups cannot be read or restored by unauthorized users thanks to server-side encryption.

###  Archiving  ###

Object storage is a cost-effective way of backing up data for the long term. This is particularly important for various situations, such as compliance with legal regulations, historical references or for future analyses.

###  Big data analytics  ###

Processing huge data sets for big data processing frameworks such as Hadoop or Spark is made possible by object storage. This allows efficient analyses to be created and insights to be gained.

###  Cloud-native application storage  ###

Object Storage provides a scalable backend for modern cloud-native applications that use the S3 API for development and deployment. It meets the requirements of dynamic applications with high availability and flexibility.

###  Digital Asset Management  ###

Object Storage is ideal for handling digital content. The data can be stored securely and can be retrieved easily from any location. Applications for sharing photos or files or social media applications, for example, benefit from this.

Frequently asked questions
----------

* **What locations will Object Storage be available?**

  Currently, Object Storage is available in the following locations: Falkenstein, DE (FSN1), Helsinki, FI (HEL1), and Nuremberg, DE (NBG1).

* **How much storage do I get?**

  You can create up to 100 Buckets. Each Bucket can store up to 100 TB of data and up to 50 million objects.

* **What is the pricing structure for Object Storage?**

  We charge a base price of €4.99 per month (excluding VAT) for using Object Storage. This base price includes 1 TB of storage (up to 744 TB-hours) and 1 TB of egress traffic. Storage and traffic that exceed the included quota are charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

* **What does “pay-as-you-go” mean in this billing model?**

  The pay-as-you-go billing model means you only pay for what you use. You are charged a base price per hour for using Object Storage. You are billed for each hour that you have at least one active Bucket, even if it’s empty. Your usage is calculated by the hour in terms of both storage and traffic. If your usage exceeds the included quota, you are billed for the excess.

* **How is the base price billed?**

  The base price is billed hourly at € 0.0081 / $ 0.0096 per hour (capped at € 4.99 € / $ 5.99 per month). You are billed for each hour that you have at least one active Bucket, even if it’s empty.

* **What traffic is free of charge?**

  The following types of traffic are free of charge:

  * Ingress traffic (data uploaded to the storage).

  * Internal traffic within the eu-central network zone.

  * S3 API calls such as PUT, GET, or DELETE requests.

* **Can I carry over unused included quota to the next month?**

  No, any unused included quota expires at the end of the month and cannot be carried over.

* **What happens if I exceed the included quota?**

  If your storage or egress traffic exceeds the included quota, additional charges will apply (All prices are exclusive of VAT):

  * Storage: € 0.0067 / $ 0.0080 per TB-hour.

  * Egress traffic: € 1.00 / $ 1.20 per TB.
  * Storage and traffic are billed with an accuracy of four decimal places (e.g. 1.2345 TB)

* **Is the included storage and traffic quota per Bucket?**

  No, the included quota applies to the total storage and traffic across all Buckets in your account.

* **How is storage consumption measured?**

  Storage is measured in TB-hours (TB-h), which reflects both the amount of data stored and the duration it is stored for. For example: Storing 1 TB for 1 hour equals 1 TB-h. Storing 10 TB for 5 hours equals 50 TB-h. Storing 1 TB in the first hour and 4 TB in the second hour equals 5 TB-h. Your total TB-hours for the month are compared to your accumulated quota.

* **What is the cost of storing very small objects (less than 64 KB)?**

  If you are using Object Storage to store objects smaller than 64 kilobytes (KB), you should be aware that our minimum object size for billing purposes is 64 KB. You can store objects smaller than 64 KB in Object Storage, but if you store (for example) a 10 KB object, you will be charged as if it were a 64 KB object.
