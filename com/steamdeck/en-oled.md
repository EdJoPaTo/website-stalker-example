Play longer, download faster
----------

#### With Steam Deck OLED, we’ve overhauled the internals, making battery life longer and downloads faster. At the same time, we made the device a bit lighter and cooler. ####

#### More time to play ####

Steam Deck OLED has 30-50% more battery life. We fit a bigger battery into the case, and the OLED display draws less power. Combined with the updated, more efficient AMD APU, you have way more time to play your favorites.

#### Faster downloads ####

Steam Deck OLED comes with Wifi 6E, offering increased bandwidth and lower latency. This means faster downloads (up to 3 times faster!) and stable online play.

#### Lighter, cooler ####

Thanks to a bigger fan and updated thermals, Steam Deck OLED runs cooler. It also weighs 30g, or \~5% lighter than the LCD model, due to the screen.

More than OLED: improvements inside and out
----------

#### Updated carrying case ####

The 1TB models (including Limited Edition) come in an exclusive case with a removable liner. This is perfect for throwing Steam Deck into your backpack when you don’t need the protection (or bulk) of the full hard case.

#### Better touchscreen ####

The touchscreen’s responsiveness and fidelity is vastly improved. Haptics are higher fidelity and more consistent. We’ve also added a dedicated Bluetooth antenna, improving connection for multiple controllers.

#### Easier to repair, easier to mod\* ####

All of the rear case screws are now Torx™ type, which screw into metal threads, making disassembly / reassembly possible without impacting structural integrity. Internal components are now easier to access, and Steam Deck OLED replacement parts will be coming to iFixit soon.

#### Full-sized controls ####

Steam Deck was built for extended play-sessions, with full size thumbsticks, buttons, and triggers positioned perfectly within your reach.

#### Trackpads ####

Play PC games that were never designed to be handheld. With increased precision and customizability, trackpads also give you a competitive edge when playing fast paced FPS games.

#### Gyro ####

With an IMU and capacitive touch thumbsticks on-board, Deck helps you aim better. By physically positioning the device you can achieve more precision than using a thumbstick or trackpad alone.

#### Grip buttons ####

Four user-assignable buttons on the back of the Deck put the next level of control right at your fingertips while keeping your thumb firmly planted on the trackpad or stick.

#### Hi-Fi audio ####

Steam Deck's stereo speakers pack a punch. An embedded DSP provides clarity and a wide soundstage for an immersive listening experience. Connect your favorite headphones, or use the onboard dual microphones to chat with your friends.

#### Fast Suspend / Resume ####

We’ve built a quick suspend / resume feature into SteamOS. Press the power button, and Steam Deck will suspend your game and go into sleep mode. Push the power button again and it will wake up right where you left off.

#### MicroSD Card Slot ####

All models of Steam Deck support expanding your storage via microSD cards. Games stored on a microSD card will appear in your library instantly.

#### Responsive Touchscreen ####

Type and swipe through Steam UI with Steam Deck's capacitive multi-touch display.
