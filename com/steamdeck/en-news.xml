						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Added an option to allow the FlickStick to trigger a Flick Turn if the stick is thrown when the action set/action layer/mode shift is activated.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Reset Camera to Horizon/Turn Camera to Face Direction/ Turn Camera 360: these actions will still work even if Flick Stick or Gyro to Mouse are removed from your settings. Dots per 360 must first be calibrated using those two modes, however.

				<b>
					General
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed search showing family games as "From the Store" instead of "In library"
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fixed incorrect counts on the search tabs in search results
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Added "View More in the Store" button to "All" tab in search
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>
					Steam Input
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed Regression: Reset to Horizon works again
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn to Face Direction: Added option to allow you to face the last known input direction if no direction is pressed. Will only fire once before a new direction input is required. This emulates "Facing the direction of the character" for many third person games.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Renamed "Calibrate Dots per 360" action to "Turn Camera 360" to better describe its function. The numeric changes to reflect the chosen number of angles, so you can easily use this to make a "Turn Camera 180" button (Note: you will always have to calibrate the Dots per 360 value in either Gyro to Mouse or FlickStick modes for each game for this turn to be accurate).

				We have just shipped an updated Steam Deck Client to the Preview/Beta channel.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
					General
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed an issue where after playing a game it would require extra B button presses to back out of the game's library page.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Settings->Storage will now display drives that are missing a steam library as format targets.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>
					Desktop Mode
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed a case where the store tab would fail to display any content after maximizing the steam window.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>
					Steam Input
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						New Configurator feature "Swap Left with Right": While editing a Controller Configuration, you can Swap the behavior of the Left Stick and the Right Stick, or Left Trackpad and Right Trackpad etc. Highlight the source you want to swap in the "Edit Layout" page, and the "Y" button should appear to allow the swap. This should be handy for "South Paws".
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						New Mouse Action: "Turn to Face Direction". When activating this, the camera will turn to face the direction you are pushing on the Left Stick (default - Track pads, Dpads and Buttons can also be used). Can be combined with "Reset to Horizon" to produce a behavior similar to Splatoon's camera reset button.  Note: Dots per 360 must be calibrated for this to be accurate.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						New Mouse Action: "Dots per 360 Calibration". By default this will generate 360 degrees of rotation. You can use this to tune the Dots per 360 value in the Flick Stick / Gyro To Mouse modes. This can also be adjusted to produce perfect 180 turns once the "Dots per 360" value is properly calibrated.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Gyro to Joystick modes now no longer generate haptic events when outside the active range.
					</li>
