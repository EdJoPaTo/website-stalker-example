				Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Beta and Preview channels, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings > System > System Update Channel.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
					General
				</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed a rare 3.6 issue that could cause filesystem corruption on Steam Deck 64GB
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fixed a 3.6 regression where an already-inserted SD card would not always be detected on cold boot and would require re-insertion
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fixed an issue where updates would could sometimes be applied incorrectly if the unit was powered off abruptly near the end of an OS update
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fixed an issue with copy-pasting UTF-8 text across applications
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b>
					Display
				</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Improved frame pacing with VRR on external displays
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fixed an issue where internal display could be abnormally limited to a lower frame rate after disconnecting an external display with VRR enabled
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>

					Developer
