				The Steam Deck Client Beta has been updated with the following changes:
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
					General
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.
						<br>
						This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.
						<br>
						Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>
					Steam Input
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Always show the controller tab in app properties for non-Steam shortcuts
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Added Invert X and Invert Y to Mouse Regions
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Scroll Wheel mode can now be chosen from the dropdown in SIAPI games (Inside of Edit Loadout, not Quick Settings)
					</li>
