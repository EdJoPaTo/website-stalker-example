				<br>
				<b>
					General
				</b>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fixed multi-line mode support in the dialog shown by the ShowGamepadTextInput API call in Steamworks
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						Fix keyboard input dialog in-game failing to close/re-open properly if Steam Overlay is toggled while visible
						<br>
					</li>

						Fix progress bar not updating during game update and move operations involving large files

				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Added support for automatic gain control for recording microphone

				<br>
				<b>
					Desktop Mode
				</b>
				<br>

						Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEODRIVER/SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER is set to wayland.
						<br>
					</li>
