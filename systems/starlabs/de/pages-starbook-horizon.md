6061 Aluminium Chassis.

 The Horizon uses a 6061 aluminium chassis for strength, rigidity, and low weight. Every panel is CNC-cut for tight tolerances and a uniform structure.

 Each surface is sand-blasted for a fine matte texture, then Type II anodised in Pantone 443. The finish resists fingerprints and hides wear.

 The chassis opens with a single PH0 screwdriver. The SSD, battery, and internals are secured with standard fasteners and no adhesive.

 13.4-inch 3:2 Display.

 The Horizon uses a 13.4-inch panel with a tall 3:2 aspect ratio. The format provides a larger vertical working area than 16:9 layouts.

 The panel refreshes at 90 Hz and reaches 500 cd/m². It uses IPS technology for consistent viewing angles and an 8-bit + 2FRC colour system for smooth gradients. The surface is finished with a hard-coat layer for durability.

 Each unit ships with a factory-fitted privacy screen protector, aligned and installed during production.

Wireless Kill Switch.

 Horizon includes a hardware kill switch for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. When activated, it asserts the physical RF-kill lines and forces the wireless modules to disable their radio circuitry internally.

 The operating system can detect the disabled state, but it cannot override it or re-enable the radios through software.

 This is not a software toggle. It is a hardware-level cutoff of radio transmission.

Built-in Webcam Privacy Cover.

 Horizon includes a physical webcam cover integrated into the chassis. A sliding mechanism moves a solid barrier in front of the camera.

 When closed, the camera is fully mechanically blocked. The assembly uses a direct mechanical linkage with no software involvement.

Open Firmware.

 Horizon runs coreboot, an open-source firmware stack with transparent code paths and configurable behaviour.

 It supports Secure Boot, BIOS Lock, TPM 2.0, Measured Boot, and Total Memory Encryption. The Intel Management Engine is disabled.

Configurable Cooling.

 Horizon includes multiple cooling profiles, including Quiet, Balanced, and Performance modes. The fan can also be disabled entirely for zero-noise operation.

 Fan behaviour integrates with coreboot performance levels, enabling configurable power limits and thermal characteristics.

Precision Trackpad.

Horizon uses a glass trackpad with support for multitouch gestures.

 A solid-state haptic trackpad upgrade is planned for late Q1 2026. Haptic designs use vibration actuators to simulate a click and contain no mechanical components.

 The upgrade will be available in multiple regional layouts, including English (UK), English (US), French, German, Nordic, and Spanish.
