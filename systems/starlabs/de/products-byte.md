About

Byte

 Welcome to a new era of Linux computing with the Byte Mk II. This compact solution doesn't compromise on the flexibility and control you've come to expect as a Linux user.

With its dual network interface controllers (NICs) and dual video outputs, the Byte Mk II is engineered for unparalleled connectivity. But more than just performance, we know that Linux users value open-source principles and robust security. That's why we've equipped the Byte Mk II with coreboot firmware, an open-source alternative to traditional BIOS, offering advanced security features such as BIOS Lock, Secure Boot, and Measured Boot.

The Byte Mk II integrates seamlessly with your Linux operating systems, delivering a smooth, reliable computing experience without the usual hardware compatibility issues. It's not just a machine; it's a testament to what's possible when hardware and software work together harmoniously.
