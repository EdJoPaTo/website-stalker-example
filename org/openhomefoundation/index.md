 The **Open Home Foundation** fights for the fundamental principles of **privacy**, **choice**, and **sustainability** for smart homes. And for every person who lives in one. It does this by supporting the development of open source projects, and open connectivity and communication standards.

Our principles
----------

### Privacy ###

Control your personal data.

 Share only what you want. With whom you want. Without modifying your behavior because of an algorithm. To ensure privacy, smart home devices must work locally, and cloud services must be optional and opt-in.

### Choice ###

Mix and match devices.

 Across manufacturers. Without vendor lock-in, or arbitrary barriers to interoperability. To ensure user choice, devices and the management of data they gather should operate via open standards and local APIs.

### Sustainability ###

Repurpose your hardware.

 And reduce your environmental impact. To ensure sustainability, devices must be built for durability, open to modification, and part of a system providing tools to track, automate, and reduce waste and emissions.

Our work
----------

 The Open Home Foundation owns and governs over **250 open source projects, standards, drivers, and libraries** like *Home Assistant*, *ESPHome*, *Music Assistant*, *HACS*, *Piper*, and more.
