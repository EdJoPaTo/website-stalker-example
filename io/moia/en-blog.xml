			Prof Dr Jochen Eckart is a transport ecologist and, as a scientist, was involved in the ARD #besserBahnfahren campaign, which examined the importance of public transport in rural and urban areas, among other things. In this interview, he reveals the results of the survey that surprised him, the role he attributes to ridepooling services in the mobility transition and which mobility measure he currently considers to be the most urgent in order to protect the environment and climate.

MOIA is taking on the role of both operator and tech provider for all vehicles. Federal Transport Minister Volker Wissing personally handed over the â‚¬26 million funding decision for ALIKE at the end of October and took a test drive in the ID. Buzz AD.
