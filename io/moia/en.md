How MOIA works
----------

 Our idea

 Ridepooling with MOIA
----------

Shared ride – that means that you share a MOIA with up to five other people - who want to travel in the same direction. This means that there are fewer cars on the streets, and the quality of life in our city improves.

Environmentally friendly, thanks to shared rides.

You’re doing something positive for our city.

 Our app

 Ridepooling redefined
----------

Your ride with MOIA is super easy: Download the app, register, enter your start, destination and the number of passengers - and you'll receive up to three offers with the guaranteed fare and estimated time of arrival. Now you just have to decide. The payment is easy via the app.

Average 200 metres walking distance.

You will be informed of your arrival time before booking.

Kids now always travel for free\*!

Children up to the age of 14 can now travel free of charge at any time when accompanied by an adult.

 Your ride

 So convenient, so relaxed
----------

Your MOIA picks you up at a stop near you - and the app guides you there. The app also shows you the pick-up and journey time, the virtual stops including preview image, the way to your pick-up location and the vehicle number three minutes before departure. And then? Get in, sit back and relax without having to search for a parking space. A screen in the MOIA shows you when you have reached your exit point.

Relax and ride thanks to privacy seats.

Alternative to carsharing, public transport and taxis.
