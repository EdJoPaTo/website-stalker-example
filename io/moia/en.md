How MOIA works
----------

 Our idea

 Ridepooling with MOIA
----------

Shared ride – that means that you share a MOIA with up to five other people - who want to travel in the same direction. This means that there are fewer cars on the streets, and the quality of life in our city improves.

Environmentally friendly, thanks to shared rides.

You’re doing something positive for our city.

 Our app

 Ridepooling redefined
----------

Your ride with MOIA is super easy: Download the app, register, enter your start, destination and the number of passengers - and you'll receive up to three offers with the guaranteed fare and estimated time of arrival. Now you just have to decide. The payment is easy via the app.

Average 200 metres walking distance.

You will be informed of your arrival time before booking.

 Your ride

 So convenient, so relaxed
----------

Your MOIA picks you up at a stop near you - and the app guides you there. The app also shows you the pick-up and journey time, the virtual stops including preview image, the way to your pick-up location and the vehicle number three minutes before departure. And then? Get in, sit back and relax without having to search for a parking space. A screen in the MOIA shows you when you have reached your exit point.

Relax and ride thanks to privacy seats.

Alternative to carsharing, public transport and taxis.

Frequently asked questions
----------

How much does the service cost?

Our price consists of two elements:

* a base price
* and a flexible price

Our vehicles and drivers are limited, so this allows us to react flexibly to demand. If fewer MOIAs are available than requested, it becomes more expensive. This is usually the case on Friday and Saturday nights, at typical commuter times or during major events. If demand is lower–for example, during the day in the week–you can get a ride at a special price. Like that, we avoid empty vehicles on the roads.

How do I order a trip?

1. Register with the MOIA app by providing your details
2. When you are signed in, you can enter your collection point, destination other passengers or child seats
3. Then click on “Get offer”
4. The MOIA Ridesharing App will give you **up to six different offers,** including price, pickup and arrival time

What are MOIA stops?

Due to German concession regulations, we are only authorized to transport you **from one virtual MOIA stop to another**. Our drivers are not allowed to take you and other passengers directly to the exact address. Virtual means that the **MOIA stop is only displayed in the app** and you won't find a marker at the stop itself. You can see the exact stops on the map and both the address and your walking distance in your **trip overview after the booking confirmation**.

When will my MOIA pick me up?

The vehicle selected for your trip will pick you up at the time and at the MOIA stop **displayed in your trip overview.**

What is MOIA Express?

If you need a faster ride but still want to use Ridesharing with MOIA, there's an additional booking option called **MOIA Express.** As an **optional upgrade** to your ride, it will bring you many **benefits:**

  * Your **arrival window** is **shorter**

  * **To ensure short walking distances, we always choose one of the closest stopping points**
