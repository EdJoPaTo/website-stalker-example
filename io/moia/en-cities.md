Frequently asked questions
----------

How much does the service cost?

Our price consists of two elements:

* a base price
* and a flexible price

Our vehicles and drivers are limited, so this allows us to react flexibly to demand. If fewer MOIAs are available than requested, it becomes more expensive. This is usually the case on Friday and Saturday nights, at typical commuter times or during major events. If demand is lower–for example, during the day in the week–you can get a ride at a special price. Like that, we avoid empty vehicles on the roads.

How do I order a trip?

2. When you are signed in, you can enter your collection point, destination other passengers or child seats
3. Then click on “Get offer”
4. The MOIA Ridesharing App will give you **up to six different offers,** including price, pickup and arrival time

What are MOIA stops?

Due to German concession regulations, we are only authorized to transport you **from one virtual MOIA stop to another**. Our drivers are not allowed to take you and other passengers directly to the exact address. Virtual means that the **MOIA stop is only displayed in the app** and you won't find a marker at the stop itself. You can see the exact stops on the map and both the address and your walking distance in your **trip overview after the booking confirmation**.

When will my MOIA pick me up?

The vehicle selected for your trip will pick you up at the time and at the MOIA stop **displayed in your trip overview.**

What is MOIA Express?

If you need a faster ride but still want to use Ridesharing with MOIA, there's an additional booking option called **MOIA Express.** As an **optional upgrade** to your ride, it will bring you many **benefits:**

* * You get to your destination **quickly** and **more directly**

  * Your **arrival window** is **shorter**
