Working together towards the mobility transition
==========

Ridepooling is already making a significant contribution to the mobility transition in cities.

**At MOIA, we’re passionate about contributing to the mobility transition in cities. Ridepooling offers a flexible and dependable alternative to owning a car. Our mission is to complement public transport and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. By working hand-in-hand with both public and private mobility providers, we’re shaping urban travel to be more sustainable and comfortable, driving the change towards better mobility.**

Our service: smart mobility solutions for you and the planet
----------

Ridepooling brings together passengers heading in similar directions, making shared journeys easy. With our app, you can book and pay for rides effortlessly. A smart algorithm creates fast and efficient routes, making ridepooling not just convenient, but also a greener way to get around. It reduces the number of cars on the road, makes better use of the existing infrastructure, and helps cut air pollution, noise, and traffic.

Our vision: making cities even more livable
----------

We work closely with mobility providers to shape urban transportation that is both flexible and responsive. As an on-demand transport service, we play a key role in Hamburg’s public transport network and actively support the Hamburg-Takt initiative. This initiative aims for 80% of all trips by 2030 to be made using eco-friendly modes of transport, such as buses, trains, bicycles, and walking, instead of motorised individual traffic. As bus and rail services continue to expand, our on-demand ridepooling helps fill the gaps, making it easier to reach this important goal.

Our users: co-creation with the best
----------

To provide our users with a comfortable electric mobility experience, it’s essential for us to truly understand their needs. In our co-creation processes, we collaborate with our customers to develop innovative ideas and solutions and place great emphasis on understanding their user habits. Many of the suggestions generated during these sessions have already made their way into our vehicles and services. We also plan to conduct extensive tests with our users on autonomous ridepooling to gain valuable insights and further enhance the MOIA experience—ensuring that our mobility offerings are enjoyed by everyone.

Our evolution: from driver-based to autonomous ridepooling
----------

We’re constantly evolving our service to make our mobility solution even more efficient and flexible. At the heart of this transformation is autonomous driving, which offers a larger ridepooling fleet that, in turn, not only helps us advance the mobility transition but also allows us to effectively implement the Hamburg-Takt initiative.

Thanks to our partnership with Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and Mobileye, we’re bringing autonomous driving right to the streets of Hamburg. This collaboration enables us to fully harness the benefits of autonomous ridepooling, making a valuable contribution to innovative urban mobility.

Hamburg: the blueprint for the future of autonomous mobility
----------

Drawing from our valuable experiences in Hamburg and Hannover, we’re supporting other cities and transport operators in successfully adopting advanced and eco-friendly on-demand mobility solutions. Our licensing model offers a comprehensive package — ranging from operational and software solutions to personalised consulting. It’s flexible and adaptable, making it suitable for both driver-operated and future autonomous ridepooling services. This way, we ensure that each city can achieve its mobility goals in the best possible way.
