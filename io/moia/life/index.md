Who
 we are

Hi!

 We are the MOIA Development Company, the tech company behind our mobility services. We are a collective of tech enthusiasts, industry specialists and designers. We design and build the digital products that make MOIA possible.

 We all love being constantly on the move. We want to create new mobility solutions to improve on existing transportation systems and make life in the city more livable. That's what makes our jobs so exciting.

How
 we work

As an innovative, growing company, MOIA stands for mobility, community and has the higher objective of making our cities a better place to live in. As a fully electric ridesharing service, we are already on the move in Hamburg and Hanover for more than two million people.

We are a tech company that stands for diversity, growth, and pioneering new approaches in the mobility sphere. Internationally we also work in cross-functional teams using the best and newest tech. Scroll down and find out more about our teams, hybrid working model, career opportunities and much much more.

Agile Coach

We value diversity by structuring our team in a cross-functional fashion. The diversity value is enabled by having a psychologically safe environment to welcome and consider diverse perspectives, dare to propose new creative ways and learn sooner from mistakes. Agile coaches make sure that the teams are empowered to speak up and gain the necessary transparency, information and tools to not only bring out the best from their expertise but also have fun while focusing on doing what they like the most.

Backend

Backend engineers continuously work with their team on finding a solution to the problems of the business, it is their responsibility to pick the right backend technology. The stack of choice is usually a serverless architecture on AWS with a language and framework that suits the purpose.

Frontend

Frontend engineers are part of cross-functional teams and work very closely with UI/UX as well as backend engineers. Their job is to build an interface, e.g., a web application or an app. The frontend is the part of our service that users see and interact with. It is always tested and improved to stay up to date with modern technologies.

Product Design

As part of the cross-functional team product designers work closely together with our UX designers, developers and product owners to understand users' needs and create concepts with visual and motion design. We always keep testing, evolving and improving the overall design language.

Product Owner

Product owners are responsible for breaking down the company vision into a strategy and roadmap for their team. They help the team identify the right problem to solve, collaboratively shape a minimal viable solution and measure the impact. They serve as an orchestrator for the feedback cycles and connect the team with stakeholders and the customers.

Quality Assurance

As a team we strive for quality at every step of our journey. A Quality Specialist is an ambassador and expert in quality matters. This means that this person ensures that quality is part of the process from beginning to end of the development cycle, as well as coaching team members on gaining confidence in the process & product.

User Experience Design

The technology and services we build must be usable, enjoyable and accessible to our users. By creating prototypes and validating hypotheses at an early stage we constantly learn, refine and push the boundaries in order to deliver an enjoyable user experience while also meeting business requirements.

 Principles of working

We play by our own rules

Stronger together

We believe only with the foundation of a strong team you can leverage each others full potential. Honoring different perspectives can really make the difference.

Team Events

Minigolf, gaming, biking, climbing, barbecue and a drink - thats our spirit.

Diversity rulez

We do everything to make our workplace a safe space for everyone, regardless of nationality, race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or ability.

Hackathon

Have a crazy idea for MOIA? Twice a year we host a company wide hackathon where we come together to build what we like.

You build it, you own it

Love taking responsibility for your work? We do too. At MOIA each team takes ownership of its product. We amplify metrics in our process, holding ourselves accountable to our promise to deliver on our product commitments.

 Hybrid work

It’s still early days as we look to find the right long-term model for MOIA yet we want this to continue being a great place for our current and future employees, and that means adapting to different needs. Since we love to collaborate it is clear to us that we don't want to become a fully remote coming, but we also don' t need to spend 5 days/week in the office to do a great job. Our hybrid work approach focuses on increased flexibility that works best for the teams and the individuals.

 Hop on board

We're always looking for amazing human beings who would like to join our team!
