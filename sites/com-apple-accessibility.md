## Magnifier

It works like a digital magnifying glass, using the camera on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod&nbsp;touch to increase the size of anything you point it at — from a prescription bottle to a candlelit menu. People Detection uses technology that measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, helping you do things like better navigate a noisy area or find an empty seat with&nbsp;ease. The LiDAR Scanner in iPhone&nbsp;13&nbsp;Pro, iPhone&nbsp;13&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;Max, iPhone&nbsp;12&nbsp;Pro, iPhone&nbsp;12&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;Max, 12.9‑inch&nbsp;iPad&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;(4th generation or later), and 11‑inch&nbsp;iPad&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;(2nd generation or later) can determine a person’s proximity to you, so you can stand or walk at a safe distance from other people around you.

## AssistiveTouch + Apple&nbsp;Watch

AssistiveTouch for watchOS enables people with upper-body limb differences to use Apple&nbsp;Watch without ever having to touch the display or controls. Using built-in motion sensors and on-device learning, Apple&nbsp;Watch detects subtle differences in muscle movements and tendon activity, letting you control the display through hand gestures like a pinch or a clench. This feature also works with VoiceOver so you can navigate Apple&nbsp;Watch with one hand while using a cane or leading a service animal. Answer incoming calls, control an onscreen motion pointer, and access Notification Center, Control Center, and&nbsp;more.
[1](#footnote-1)

AssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS helps you adapt standard gestures like pinch, rotate, or swipe to make them more comfortable for you. You can make other actions, like changing volume, accessible with just a touch from the AssistiveTouch&nbsp;menu.

Clench. Clench. Chat.

## VoiceOver

VoiceOver is an industry-leading screen reader that describes exactly what’s happening on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple&nbsp;Watch, Apple&nbsp;TV, or iPod&nbsp;touch, so you can navigate just by listening. You can now explore even more details about the people, text, table data, and other objects within images.
[6](#footnote-6)
Hear receipts or labels read like a table –– by row and column, complete with headers. VoiceOver can also describe a person’s position in relation to objects within images, so you can relive memories in greater detail. Switching between common actions is even easier with the new Quick Settings menu on iPhone and iPad. VoiceOver actions sync automatically across devices, and its volume adjusts when you speak. And in case you accidentally turn on Flashlight, a new alert lets you know it’s&nbsp;on.

Puts moments into&nbsp;words.
