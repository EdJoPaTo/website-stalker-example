    Magnifier
    ----------

    It works like a digital magnifying glass, using the camera on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to increase the size of anything you point it at — from a prescription bottle to a candlelit menu. People Detection uses technology that measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, helping you do things like better navigate a noisy area or find an empty seat with ease. The LiDAR Scanner in iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, 12.9‑inch iPad Pro (4th generation or later), and 11‑inch iPad Pro (2nd generation or later) can determine a person’s proximity to you, so you can stand or walk at a safe distance from other people around you.

    AssistiveTouch + Apple Watch
    ----------

    AssistiveTouch for watchOS enables people with upper-body limb differences to use Apple Watch without ever having to touch the display or controls. Using built-in motion sensors and on-device learning, Apple Watch detects subtle differences in muscle movements and tendon activity, letting you control the display through hand gestures like a pinch or a clench. This feature also works with VoiceOver so you can navigate Apple Watch with one hand while using a cane or leading a service animal. Answer incoming calls, control an onscreen motion pointer, and access Notification Center, Control Center, and more.

    AssistiveTouch for iOS and iPadOS helps you adapt standard gestures like pinch, rotate, or swipe to make them more comfortable for you. You can make other actions, like changing volume, accessible with just a touch from the AssistiveTouch menu.
