iPadOS 15
==========

Work wonders.
 With ease.

iPad enables you to do so much, so easily. iPadOS 15 takes this versatility further, making it easier to get things done, find and organize information, and make iPad even more capable.

Multitasking
----------

The large iPad screen is great for working with multiple apps, taking your productivity to a whole new level. And now with iPadOS 15, multitasking is easier to discover, easier to use, and even more powerful.

### New Multitasking menu ###

Tap to reveal a new Multitasking menu that lets you create a full screen, Slide Over, Split View, and in some instances, a center window, so you can work on multiple apps at once.

### Choose an app ###

When you choose a multitasking layout, you get access to your Home Screen, where you can select from your apps, and choose which ones you want to work with at the same time.

### Split View ###

Your apps appear side by side. Swipe down from the top of the app you want to replace, then choose a new one from the Home Screen.

### Choose an app ###

When you choose a multitasking layout, you get access to your Home Screen, where you can select from your apps, and choose which ones you want to work with at the same time.

### Split View ###

Your apps appear side by side. Swipe down from the top of the app you want to replace, then choose a new one from the Home Screen.

### Center window ###

Touch and hold to bring an email, note, or message to the center of the screen without leaving your current view. The Multitasking menu appears here, too.

### The new shelf ###

View all the open windows for an app and quickly switch between them with the new shelf. You can even add and close windows.

### App Switcher ###

Now you can create Split View spaces in one screen with the App Switcher. Create a Split View by dragging one app over another.

### Keyboard shortcuts ###

Attach a keyboard to your iPad and view a list of all shortcuts. Press and hold the Command key to view shortcuts for an app, multitasking, and more.

Widgets and App Library
----------

There are so many things you can do with iPad and all the amazing apps designed for it. Now App Library automatically organizes those apps for you. And new widgets let you see information at a glance, right on your Home Screen.

### Widgets on the Home Screen ###

Now you can place widgets among apps on your iPad. And with a new larger widget size, you can take full advantage of the iPad canvas.

### All-new widgets ###

Find My, Contacts, Game Center, App Store, and Mail all have new widgets. And many widgets now come in the new larger size.

### App Library ###

App Library is now on iPad. It automatically organizes your apps into helpful categories like Productivity and Games. And for quick access, it’s built right into the Dock.

Quick Note and Notes
----------

iPad is the world’s best note-taking device. And now Notes goes system‑wide with Quick Note, a fast and easy way to get to a note no matter what you’re doing.

### Start a Quick Note anywhere ###

Jot down information over any app or screen. Start a Quick Note with a keyboard shortcut, from Control Center, or with a swipe up from the corner using your finger or Apple Pencil.

Pause Play Replay

### Put anything in a Quick Note ###

Add handwriting, links, Safari highlights, tags, and mentions to a Quick Note so you can get to important names, numbers, and ideas easily.

### Thumbnails appear in context ###

Highlight text in Safari or add a link from an app, and you’ll see a Quick Note thumbnail next time you visit the site, taking you right to what you were viewing before. And if you make a Quick Note on your iPad, it will be on your iPhone and Mac, too.

### View all Quick Notes ###

Access all of your Quick Notes right in the Notes app.

### Organize and notify ###

Tag a note using the # symbol and a keyword, then find it later in the Tag Browser. See what others have added to your shared note with the Activity view, and notify them with mentions. To notify someone on a note, just type a person’s name and it will be highlighted.

New experiences.
True connections.
----------

Staying in touch is more essential than ever. With SharePlay, you can watch together, listen together, and share your screen right inside FaceTime. FaceTime calls also sound and feel more natural. And Messages makes it even easier to find and enjoy the great content shared from friends and family.

### FaceTime ###

#### Introducing SharePlay ####

Keep FaceTime conversations going as you watch TV shows and movies, listen to music, or share your screen. SharePlay is an entirely new way to have experiences with family and friends, no matter the distance.

#### Watch together ####

Stream movies and TV shows while on a FaceTime call with friends. With synced playback and controls, you’ll see everyone laugh, jump, and react to the same moments at the same time. And the volume automatically adjusts, so you can keep talking while you watch.

More about Watch together

#### Watch together ####

Watch your favorite videos, movies, and TV shows in sync with friends. The following apps and streaming services will support SharePlay later this year.

Disney+, Hulu, HBOmax, NBA, twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, ESPN+, Paramount+, Pluto TV

#### Listen together ####

Get together and listen to an album with friends. The whole group can see what’s next and add songs to a shared queue with synced playback and easy‑to‑use controls.

#### Share your screen ####

Share your screen with everyone in your FaceTime call. Browse apartment listings, swipe through a photo album, or teach someone a new skill, all while seeing and talking to one another.

#### Spatial audio ####

Individual voices sound like they’re coming from the direction in which each person is positioned on your screen, helping conversations flow more naturally.

#### Grid view ####

Grid view shows people on your FaceTime call in the same-size tiles, so you can have better conversations with a large group. The speaker is automatically highlighted so you always know who’s talking.

#### Portrait mode ####

Inspired by Portrait mode in Camera, this new video effect puts the focus on you, not what’s behind you.

#### Mic modes ####

Voice Isolation minimizes background noise and puts your voice front and center. When the music or sounds around you are as important as what you have to say, Wide Spectrum leaves the ambient sound unfiltered.

Mic modes available for FaceTime are Default, Voice Isolation, or Wide Spectrum.

More about Mic modes

#### Mic modes ####

With Voice Isolation, your mic uses machine learning to block ambient and distracting noises (like dogs barking or a TV in the next room) to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.

 Wide Spectrum lets your friends on FaceTime hear every sound happening where you are. It’s ideal for taking music lessons or for when you want someone to listen to what’s going on around you.

#### FaceTime links ####

Schedule and share FaceTime calls with a unique web link.

More about FaceTime links

#### FaceTime links ####

Make a unique FaceTime web link to easily set up a call for later or share the link with a group. Share it with your friends in Messages, Mail, or third‑party apps like WhatsApp. You can also generate a link for an event in Calendar, so everyone will know exactly where and when to meet.

#### Invite anyone to FaceTime ####

Now you can send friends and family a link to connect on FaceTime — even if they’re using Windows or Android. And it’s still end-to-end encrypted, so your call is as private and secure as any other FaceTime call.

### Messages and Memoji ###

#### Shared with You ####

Now the links, images, and other content shared with you in Messages are featured in a new Shared with You section in the corresponding app. You can even reply right from the app you’re enjoying it from — without going back to Messages.

#### Shared with You in apps ####

Shared with You is built into Photos, Safari, Apple News, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app.

#### New Memoji ####

Now you can choose outfits for your Memoji and express yourself with new stickers. Represent your look and style with multicolor headwear. And accessibility customizations now include cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.

#### Photo collections ####

Multiple photos in Messages now appear as a collage or an elegant stack of images that you can swipe through. Tap to view them all as a grid or add a quick Tapback. And save them to your library with just a few taps.

Be in the moment.
----------

A powerful new set of tools gives you more control over how you prioritize your time and attention. So you can find balance and stay focused on whatever you’re doing in the moment.

### Focus ###

#### Match your devices to your mindset ####

Focus helps you stay in the moment when you need to concentrate or step away. Choose from a list of Focus options or create your own to allow only the notifications you want — you can get work done while you’re in the zone or enjoy a distraction‑free dinner.

What do you want to focus on? Choose a focus area to set up: Custom. Driving. Excerising. Gaming. Reading.

#### Signal your status ####

Stepping away is easier if others know you’re busy. So when you're using Focus, your status will be automatically displayed in Messages and shared with other communication apps you allow. And for truly urgent messages, there’s still a way for people to notify you.

### Notifications ###

#### Redesigned notifications ####

Notifications have a new look, including contact photos and larger app icons to make them easier to identify.

#### Notification summary ####

Quickly catch up with a helpful collection of your notifications delivered daily, based on a schedule you set. The summary is intelligently ordered by priority, with the most relevant notifications at the top.

Privacy
----------

Great features should not have to come at the expense of your privacy. iPadOS 15 provides increased visibility into how apps access your data, protects you from unwanted data collection, and gives you more control over what you choose to share.

### App Privacy Report ###

See how apps are using the permissions you’ve granted them, which domains they contact, and how recently they made contact.

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Catch up on email with more peace of mind.

More about Mail Privacy Protection

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.

### Siri ###

Audio of your Siri requests never leaves your device.

More about Siri

### Siri ###

Siri adds on-device speech recognition, so the audio of your requests is processed on your iPhone or iPad by default. And on-device processing also means Siri can perform many tasks without an internet connection.

### Introducing iCloud+ ###

Get everything you already love about iCloud — and new features including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support.

Beta  ###

Browse the web with more privacy.

More about iCloud Private Relay Beta

###  iCloud Private Relay
Beta  ###

iCloud Private Relay is a service that lets you connect to virtually any network and browse with Safari in an even more secure and private way. It ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted and uses two separate internet relays so no one can use your IP address, location, and browsing activity to create a detailed profile about you.

### Hide My Email ###

Instantly generate unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox — so you don’t have to share your real email address when filling out a form on the web or signing up for a newsletter. Hide My Email is built into Mail, Safari, and iCloud Settings.

And so much more.
----------

### Accessibility. ###

Customize display and text size settings for each app. Bold or enlarge text, increase contrast, invert colors, and more for only the apps you want. Explore people, objects, text, and tables within images in more detail with VoiceOver. Navigate receipts and nutrition label values in logical order. And move your finger over a photo to discover a person’s position relative to other objects in the image.

### Translate. ###

The Translate app is now on iPadOS. System‑wide translation lets you translate text that you select, even in many third‑party apps. In the app, Auto Translate and face to face view improve conversation flow and make it easier to follow along.

### Find My. ###

### Apple ID. ###

Account Recovery Contacts makes resetting your password and maintaining access to your account easier than ever. And a new Digital Legacy program lets you designate people as Legacy Contacts so they can access your account in the event of your death.

### Games. ###

You can now browse and start games from the new Games category in App Library or easily capture an exciting moment with a wide variety of game controllers. And Game Center makes it easier to play with your most recent Messages friends and groups.

### Siri. ###

You can now ask Siri to share items onscreen like photos, web pages, news, and more. If the item can’t be shared, Siri will offer to send a screenshot instead.
