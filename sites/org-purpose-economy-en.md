OWNERSHIP FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY
----------

Steward-ownership is shifting the tide away from value-extraction and short-termism towards stewardship, independence, and long-term purpose.
----------

Steward-ownership structurally retools who holds control in companies and what motivates decisions. By disrupting the relationship between power/money and the purpose of business, steward-ownership is a powerful agent for economic change.
