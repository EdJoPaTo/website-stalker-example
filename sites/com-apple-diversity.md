Leadership matters.
For this generation and the next.
----------

Inclusive representation in leadership is a powerful driver of progress. At Apple, leaders of all backgrounds are working to grow and develop our next generation of leaders from within.

### Representation in leadership matters. ###

We’re committed to increasing the number of managers from underrepresented communities, because differences in our backgrounds, our identities, and the way we think ultimately make our teams stronger and more innovative.

### Expanding the Apple Mentorship Program globally. ###

Our new mentorship program creates opportunities for Apple employees of all backgrounds to learn from one another and grow their careers at Apple. After successful pilot programs in the U.S. and the U.K., we are continuing to expand the program globally, pairing a greater number of experienced Apple mentors with future leaders from across the company.

### More board directors with diverse perspectives. ###

More than half of our board of directors identify as women and/or members of Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQ+, and Veterans communities. And women hold half of our board and committee leadership positions.

### Support for development at every level. ###

Opportunity starts with equitable access to career development programs and support. From new‑hire orientation to talent planning, we’re embedding programs, processes, and resources that support employees and help current leaders identify and develop future leaders equitably.

Priya Sumal
----------

She/her, Senior Manager GPU Software, Co‑chair Women@Apple

Priya manages teams of test engineers that make sure Apple’s GPU software remains best in class. As co-chair of the Santa Clara Valley chapter of Women@Apple, an employee-led Diversity Network Association (DNA) group, and an active Apple mentor, she strives to broaden her DNA’s programming and support women’s career development. Priya credits her upbringing with inspiring her advocacy and says DNAs have been an outstanding vehicle to grow that part of her vision.

> quote by Priya

> The DNAs gave me so much, I want to be able to give back, and it is the best way I can give back, I feel, for Apple.

Since joining Apple to work on the first iPhone, Priya has seen the power of communication at work. She believes open discussion not only helps her be a more vocal “introvert,” but also empowers others to continue the Apple rock-tumbler tradition of letting ideas bounce off each other until they’re more refined.

“Being able to just talk openly about women’s rights has made me more of a feminist. Someone who will fight for women’s voices.”

### Quique puts inclusive
practices to work. ###

Quique Atienza
----------

He/him, Senior Market Director Americas West, South and Latin America, Co–executive Sponsor Familia@Apple

As a senior market director and co–executive sponsor of Familia@Apple, a Hispanic/Latinx DNA group, Quique is humbled to work with great people across the globe. He believes strong leadership skills come from learning.

> quote by Quique

> We all must continue leading with respect and create environments where people feel they can come to work as themselves and feel welcome.

He’s excited about the growth of Familia@Apple and the power of DNA groups to support the Hispanic/Latinx communities inside and outside Apple. “I think we all have an opportunity to contribute every single day with inclusion and diversity in every interaction that we have.”

Years of experience working across Europe and the U.S. have taught Quique that progress relies on accountability — and that’s exactly what he’s implementing. He’s deeply involved in retooling hiring initiatives in Retail, creating policies designed with inclusion in mind. “If you have the right approach to diversity in your sourcing efforts, in your candidate pipeline, and in your interview panels, then you’ll naturally surface the best talent.”

### Progress takes listening.
 And action. ###

Read more about how we make progress.

Progress takes listening.
 And action.
----------

Accountability measures across the company allow us to track progress and build a foundation for lasting and durable change. We’re listening to employee feedback, amplifying underrepresented voices, and taking action to meet our teams’ needs.

### Transparency and accountability in every line of business. ###

From hiring to development and engagement, we’re making sure every part of Apple is increasing inclusion and representation. Senior leaders now have access to data that helps them assess how well they are driving diversity within their teams and organizations.

### Executive compensation is tied to our values. ###

We incorporate our Apple values — including inclusion and diversity — and key community initiatives into our executives’ annual cash incentive program.

### Continued learning and resources provided for every manager. ###

Equitable, inclusive experiences for all employees begin with equipping our leaders with the resources they need. Apple’s more than 15,000 managers are trained in unconscious bias and inclusive leadership. And managers are offered expert-led courses to support their ongoing education on topics including race and justice, allyship, and more.

### Action plans for every line of business. ###

We’re building inclusion and diversity measures into our annual review process to create consistency in how we drive and track progress. In the last year, we completed comprehensive data reviews with executive leadership and organizational action plans within every line of business.

### Employee feedback is put into action. ###

Our people are at the heart of our progress. Their voices and ideas drive innovation in everything we do — from informing diversity initiatives to the inclusive benefits that support employees of all backgrounds through every life stage. People and communities across Apple help shape our internal inclusion and diversity strategy, the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and inclusive product innovations.

### Partnering

Partnering
 to challenge systemic
bias.
----------

Research and development (R&D) teams are the fastest growing at Apple. R&D is also an area where diversity continues to lag across the tech industry. We have several ongoing and upcoming initiatives to help break down systemic barriers and bias in R&D and beyond.

### Making a difference with underrepresented communities. ###

In addition to Apple programs like Entrepreneur Camp, Impact Accelerator, and the Apple Developer Academy, Apple partners with external organizations to support and serve people from underrepresented communities. Many of our partnerships also provide opportunities for our engineers and other employees to engage with the next generation of innovators by offering their time as mentors and volunteers.

### We’re proud to engage with organizations including: ###

AnitaB.org, American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), *FIRST*, Girls Who Code, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), Human Rights Campaign (HRC), National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), The Prince’s Trust, Rewriting the Code, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF).

### Building on our work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. ###

In collaboration with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Apple offers internship opportunities to students across more than 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) — and we continue to welcome graduates of our program who transition to permanent roles at Apple.

With support through Apple’s Community Education Initiative — designed to bring coding, creativity, and workforce development opportunities to learners of all ages — Tennessee State University’s HBCU C<sup>2</sup> initiative is creating more opportunities that will diversify the tech workforce by removing barriers, innovating STEAM education, and developing lifelong learning pathways for HBCUs, their students, and the communities they serve.

### More than 100 scholarships each year. ###

Building on the success of the Apple HBCU Scholars program, Apple is committed to expanding opportunities for more students from more communities. With our partners, we continue to create over 100 additional scholarships annually for STEAM students from underrepresented communities. The Apple Scholars program includes financial support, mentorship, and career development experience.

### Expanding our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. ###

Apple is committed to helping grow opportunities for communities of color, particularly for the Black community. Our initial $100 million commitment to the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI) focuses on three key areas to create lasting change: expanding access to education, supporting criminal justice reform, and removing barriers for entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities.

We’ve since added $30 million in new commitments, and we’re continuing to grow our work and partnerships and create more educational and career opportunities for students from underrepresented groups. Apple continues to support HBCU engineering programs as part of REJI. Our Innovation Grants help HBCU colleges of engineering develop silicon and hardware engineering curricula in partnership with Apple experts. The Faculty Fellows Program assists HBCU educators pursuing R&D with mentorship programs, curriculum development, and funds to equip lab spaces. Most recently, Apple partnered with the California State University (CSU) to launch a Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub. This public-private partnership between the state of California, the CSU, and Apple will work in collaboration with Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) throughout the U.S. to foster student success by equipping learners — including students who identify as Asian and Asian Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic/Latinx — with skills for high-demand careers.

Kayode Adegeye
----------

He/him, Partner Communications Manager, Member of the People Engagement Committee

Kayode leads initiatives that raise awareness around challenges facing Brazil’s Black community, with a focus on institutional racism in business and education. He applies skills he has mastered as a partner communications manager to create content that prompts others inside and outside Apple to inform more inclusive views on race in Brazil.

> quote by Kayode

> I think the more you can add something to the team that reflects the reality of society, the better the work.

Deeply impacted by the death of George Floyd, Kayode mobilized his colleagues to produce content to educate their peers on topics like racial bias and inequity in Brazil. He led a panel hosted by the Black@Apple community in Austin to discuss the historical roots of Brazil’s Black Awareness Day. He also organized a conversation with an influential Apple Music host on music, leadership, and inclusion to raise awareness and understanding.

Kayode says one of the first steps in countering racial bias is fostering empathy and open-mindedness. He’s helping launch a chapter of Black@Apple throughout Latin America and the Caribbean to create even more support for local communities. And he feels hopeful his work is among other efforts that will make a difference.

Wendy Santos
----------

She/her, Retail Manager, Co-lead Indigenous@Apple

As a retail manager and co-lead of Indigenous@Apple, Wendy helps teams unearth connections between their work and the larger community in Hawaii. With close to 10 years at Apple, she’s seen how good intentions can build strong bridges.

> quote by Wendy

> What we’re able to do as a DNA group is bring heart to our work, bring who we authentically are beyond just our roles within Apple.

Wendy, a founding member of Indigenous@Apple, cultivates partnerships with Apple services teams that integrate Indigenous culture into their work on Music, Maps, and other products. For Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, she worked with Apple Music to create a radio station featuring local artists capturing the spirit of *pa’u hana*, a Native Hawaiian tradition of bonding and storytelling after work.

Wendy knows there’s a lot more everyone can do to respect and understand Indigenous cultures and looks forward to forging more bonds between her work and her community. “When we get to help our teams connect to the bigger picture and purpose, we get to make more of an impact.”

### Community

Community
 is the core of our culture.
----------

Building an inclusive culture rooted in community helps everyone, in every part of Apple, feel supported, valued, connected, and empowered to do the best work of their lives. Because we know we are all better at what we do when we’re free to be who we are.

### Building connections and understanding within Apple. ###

For more than 35 years, Apple employees have found community and connection in Apple’s Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These employee‑led groups foster a culture of belonging through education, leadership development, networking, and volunteering — while also encouraging the kind of open dialogue that leads to stronger allyship across Apple.

In the last year, we’ve grown our global communities more than 50 percent, including expansions in Apple Store locations and across all regions. More than 55,000 Apple employees belong to groups like Accessibility@Apple, AsianPacific@Apple, Beacon@Apple, Black@Apple, Familia@Apple, Indigenous@Apple, Pride@Apple, SouthAsian@Apple, Veterans@Apple, Women@Apple, and more.

Many of our community-led initiatives and volunteer engagements drive progress within the business as well as outside Apple in local communities. Each month, DNAs around the world lead heritage celebrations that are available to everyone at Apple, from global open mic events and educational sessions to time-zone-defying community conversations. DNA communities also partner with teams across Apple — from Fitness+ to the App Store — to create limited-edition challenges and badges, tell intersectional stories, curate reading lists, improve product features and functionality, and more. Whether thought-provoking or entertaining, each experience is designed to deepen connection and understanding.

### Continuing to take action for communities everywhere. ###

We’ll continue to speak openly about our efforts to eradicate systemic racism and injustice. We remain steadfast advocates on behalf of LGBTQ+ people because LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. We stay true to our values by acting when policies unfairly target immigrants and other communities. And we’ll always stand against prejudice in any form.

Hiring practices with shared goals in mind.
----------

To create products for everyone in the world, we need a workforce with diverse backgrounds and experiences. We’re making continuous progress in building an Apple community that represents the diverse and ever-changing world we live in. And we’re committed to far more.

### Inclusive hiring standards and processes. ###

We’ve built inclusion and diversity measures into our candidate assessment framework. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of having more diverse interview panels and candidates so that diversity is reflected at every stage of the hiring process.

### More robust diversity recruiting efforts for R&D and leadership. ###

We’re working to accelerate progress through our diversity recruiting and hiring efforts across Apple, with a focus on technical, engineering, and leadership roles.

### Expansive diversity outreach and external partnerships. ###

We are expanding our diversity outreach efforts, including our ties with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and other organizations that serve and engage talent from underrepresented communities.

### Inclusive hiring training is our practice globally. ###

Whether it’s by participating in an interview panel or serving as a hiring manager, bringing people into Apple is an important responsibility. We’re making sure everyone involved in the hiring process has access to the information and resources they need to develop inclusive interviewing skills. All of our hiring managers and recruiters receive training in inclusive hiring practices. Our recruiters also receive training on how to continuously drive meaningful conversations with hiring managers to help implement these hiring practices with every role. These trainings help mitigate inherent biases and create more consistent hiring experiences for all.

Dave Fischer
----------

He/him, Director of Software – Headphones, Accessories, and Systems

Creating positive impact has been a priority for Dave since he started at Apple. Together with his recruiting partners, he reworked his team’s hiring process to invite a wider pool of diverse talent. They refined technical interview questions and implemented a novel panel approach to ensure more consistent candidate evaluation.

> quote by Dave

> I think an important part of eliminating bias is to avoid the bias that creeps in from individual questions and preferences.

Not only did they meet their goal of bringing new voices onto the team, they were able to create room for new positions too. He says the changes in staffing can only benefit customers.

“Having that representation, and the ability to build empathy and understand how customers will use our products in different locales and cultures, is really critical.”

Dave knows hiring is only a first step toward creating more inclusive teams. “We all are part of different backgrounds and cultures, so the ability to come together and to work collaboratively — to make sure that everyone’s voice is heard — is a critical part of that as well.”

“I think that all of us are more successful when we work with each other in a respectful, clear, and open way.”

Yuli Yang
----------

She/her, Chief of Staff for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (APAC), Women@Apple, AsiaPacific@Apple

Yuli is a longtime champion of inclusion and diversity in engineering at Apple. Her role as chief of staff for AI/ML in APAC provides her with opportunities to create a more inclusive environment for the many engineering teams she works with throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

> quote by Yuli

> I want people to feel strong speaking for themselves. And to create an environment where everyone can contribute their best; that’s something every one of us really wants.

Conversation and receiving feedback are key to Yuli’s leadership approach. When she heard that mothers wanted more support after giving birth, she took action. She has been instrumental in increasing the number of nursing rooms available in Apple offices and manufacturing sites. “If you are not intentionally inclusive, then you are unintentionally exclusive,” she says.

Yuli knows there’s always more to learn, and she leans heavily on her colleagues to help her create positive change. “I say to others: Speak up for what you want to do and people around you will support you.”

She/her, Information Systems and Technology Project Manager, Co-founding Co‑chair Women@Apple Cork

For more than 30 years, Olive, an Information Systems and Technology project manager, has watched as Apple’s Cork, Ireland, headquarters grew from a small team to a large, diverse staff serving much of the world. All of this growth presented some unique challenges, but also unique opportunities to deepen Apple’s global commitment to inclusion.

> quote by Olive

> We can go anywhere in the world, but we always travel with our name. It’s something that we’re all known by, and it’s unique.

Olive helped create a feature in Apple’s internal directory that allows employees to record a pronunciation of their names. As with all great ideas, seeing this one through took building bridges. Her role as a leader of the Women@Apple Cork chapter enabled her to connect with leaders across the company to take the idea from a hackathon floor to reality.

“People are not expected to be the same at Apple. They’re expected to bring their whole selves to work, bring whoever they are in their diversity, and that really promotes inclusion.”

Rose Ghahary
----------

She/her, Retail Manager, Lead Pride@Apple

More than anything, Rose, a store manager, considers herself a leader. Over the span of her five-year career in Apple Retail, she’s made it a point to strengthen the people and processes that make Apple what it is.

> quote by Rose

> I’m someone on my store’s leadership team, but besides even just that team, I’m someone who leads by example.

As an active member of Pride@Apple, an LGBTQ+ DNA group, she’d heard stories from trans and gender nonconforming employees that their teams were sometimes unsure of how to support them, stories that mirrored her own experience. She’s been working to build and improve support systems for her community at Apple ever since.

Through Pride@Apple, Rose works to improve how people understand, think, and talk about queer identity. She created and leads an inclusive leadership training for retail stores across the country, helps program Apple’s celebration of the International Transgender Day of Visibility, and frequently serves on leadership panels with other employees. She says sometimes getting the conversation started around diversity and inclusion is the hardest part.

“I think if you have the best intent and understand why you’re jumping into these conversations, you can only positively impact the people around you.”

The Apple Store is where creativity and community come together.
----------

Across the globe, our Apple Store team members are committed to caring for each other and customers as well as building strong connections to the communities they serve. They know our products and services inside and out — and aim to make everyone feel welcome. At the same time, they’re building locally customized programs to address the needs specific to each community.

### Global and local programs. ###

Apple Store team members offer Today at Apple programs as a free resource for all. Each program is designed for people of all ages and backgrounds, and many are customized to meet the needs of local communities. These sessions help people get inspired, develop new skills, and start creating — for themselves or their communities.

### Empowering creatives through career building. ###

This past year, Apple launched an innovative new community program, Today at Apple Creative Studios, to provide career-building mentorship and training for young people facing barriers to meaningful artistic education and resources. Working in partnership with nonprofit community organizations, Creative Studios has amplified emerging artists’ voices in Beijing, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Washington, D.C.

Designed
 with

----------

We’ve always known that in order to create the most personal technology in the world, we must consider the full range of human experiences.

### Think outside the screen. ###

All across Apple there is a sustained commitment to making products more inclusive. Apple accessibility engineers work hand in hand with a wide array of teams to help solve unique problems others seldom think about. For example, how does someone who’s blind or low vision know when to move forward in line at a cafe?

The answer started with the video engineering team while working with the technology called LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). It uses a pulsed laser to “ping” nearby objects to generate a 3D model of the surrounding environment, similar to how bats or dolphins use sound pulses to sense the world around them.

But what started as a prototype to make life more convenient became a necessity once COVID-19 hit. Our teams’ ongoing conversations with the Blind community led to a more pressing issue: How does a blind or low-vision person practice social distancing? Cross-team communication and collaboration rallied our teams so we could fast-track the LiDAR Scanner prototype to create what is now our People Detection feature. Improving lives is great, but helping to save lives is even better.

### Tu makes Apple Watch

Tu Nguyen
----------

He/him, Senior Software Engineer, watchOS

Tu’s journey at Apple started in college. When he wasn’t poring through computer science books, he was working part time as an Apple Store Specialist and Genius. As an engineer working with the watchOS Accessibility team, Tu helped create technology that enables people to do more with their lives, no matter their accessibility needs.

> quote by Tu

> I got into computer science and software engineering in general to see people use what I build. And with AssistiveTouch in particular, it’s not just them using it, it’s enabling them to use the entire thing.

AssistiveTouch, which Tu’s team led the development of for watchOS, helps people use Apple Watch if they have difficulty touching the screen or pressing buttons. It allows hand gestures and simple movements like tilting and using a clenched fist or pinched fingers to control the device and is especially helpful for people with limb differences.

The years of work he put into the development process brought Tu closer to why he became an engineer. AssistiveTouch reflects not only his personal values, but a unique companywide commitment to accessibility.

“Everyone at Apple, including leadership, knows this is just the right thing to do. There’s no reason why we can’t build for accessibility, so we do it.”

We’re moving forward, together.

We have more than 165,000 talented employees across the world, and many find fulfillment at Apple for many years. We’re making progress in increasing representation, and currently, 50 percent of our workforce in the U.S. is made up of people from underrepresented communities. Because even a 1 percent improvement impacts a substantial number of people, increasing overall representation takes time.

### More Inclusive Leadership ###

Compared to the previous year, open leadership roles filled by women globally increased by 10 percentage points overall, and by 8 percentage points in R&D. And in the U.S., open leadership roles filled by people from underrepresented communities increased by 16 percentage points overall, and by 9 percentage points in R&D.

1. Leadership roles include managers at all levels of our company.

2. Underrepresented communities (URCs): groups whose representation in tech has been historically low — Female, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Multiracial, and Indigenous peoples.

3. Tech roles are based on Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 skill designations. At Apple, this includes all technical roles across the company, such as engineering roles and Apple Store Geniuses.

Data supplied by the People team at Apple. Totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

To align with U.S. government reporting requirements, data on this website uses the traditional gender categories of male and female. Apple deeply respects that gender is not binary.

Though we do not use the [Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1](https://www.apple.com/diversity/pdf/2020-Final-Certified-Apple-EEO-1-Report.pdf) to measure progress, our most recent filing is publicly available.
