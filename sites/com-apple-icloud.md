# iCloud

## The best place for all your photos, files, and more.

iCloud is built into every Apple device. That means all your stuff — photos, files, notes, and more — is safe, up to date, and&nbsp;available wherever you are. Everyone gets 5GB of free iCloud storage to start. And you can upgrade to iCloud+ anytime for&nbsp;powerful new features and more storage.

## iCloud Photos

### All your photos and&nbsp;videos.

Always&nbsp;available.

#####
#### A lifetime of photos

on all your devices.

With iCloud&nbsp;Photos, you can browse, search, and share all the photos and videos from any of your devices, whether they were taken yesterday or years ago. Features like face recognition and object detection are processed locally on your device through machine learning, rather than in the cloud. And apps can only access your photos with your&nbsp;permission.

#####
#### Take all the photos you&nbsp;want. Without worrying about space on your devices.

To save space on your devices, the original, full‑resolution photos you take are automatically uploaded to iCloud. You’ll still always have a lightweight version of every photo on your device, and you can download the originals whenever you need&nbsp;them.

#####
#### The easiest way to share photos with friends and&nbsp;family.

Shared Albums lets you create albums for trips, events, or whatever you want. Simply choose the friends and family members who can see, comment, and add their own photos and videos.

## iCloud Drive

### Any type of file.

All in one place.

#####
#### All your files available from all your devices.

The files you keep safe in iCloud&nbsp;Drive are easy to get to, no matter which device you’re using. You can access all your files from the Files app on iOS and iPadOS, the Finder on your Mac, File&nbsp;Explorer for Windows PCs, or&nbsp;iCloud.com.

#####
#### Organize files however you want. Get to them on any device you want.

iCloud&nbsp;Drive lets you organize your files with folders, rename them, and tag them with colors. And when you make a change, the update is made across all your devices. You can even have everything in your Mac Desktop and Documents folders automatically available in iCloud&nbsp;Drive.

#####
#### Share folders and files with ease.

iCloud Drive makes it fast and easy to work with others from anywhere. Just send a private link and they’ll get instant access to the folders and files you’ve chosen to share. You control whether they can view, share, or edit each file, and you can change these settings at any time. And anyone can participate since it works across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows PCs, and the web.

## Apps using iCloud

### Your favorite apps are

even&nbsp;better with&nbsp;iCloud.

#####
#### All your essentials.

Accessible from all your&nbsp;devices.

iCloud automatically keeps apps — including Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Safari, and some of your favorite apps from the App&nbsp;Store — updated across all your devices. So when you add a new phone number, bookmark a website, or update a slide in a presentation, the change appears&nbsp;everywhere.

#####
#### Collaborate with Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and&nbsp;Notes.

Work with others on documents, presentations, and spreadsheets and see edits as they’re made. With live updates on all your devices, your collaborators will always be on the same page.

#####
#### Every message. Updated across all your&nbsp;devices.

iCloud automatically stores all of your messages. Search for an address, a funny exchange, or anything else. And you can pick up every conversation right where you left off. Even when you move to a new phone or&nbsp;computer.

## iCloud Backup and Restore

### All the things that&nbsp;matter.

Safe and secure.

#####
#### Automatic backups give you peace of&nbsp;mind.

iCloud automatically backs up your iOS and iPadOS devices when they’re connected to power and Wi-Fi. So if you lose your device or get a new one, you’ll have all the things that matter without missing a beat.

#####
#### Move to a new device with everything you loved about your old&nbsp;one.

iCloud makes moving your settings, photos, apps, and documents to a new device seamless. Just sign in to iCloud when you set up your new device, and you’ll be ready to go in&nbsp;minutes.

### Two‑factor authentication helps&nbsp;keep your data&nbsp;safe.

Two‑factor authentication is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that only you&nbsp;can access your account. That means your account can only be accessed on devices you trust, like your iPhone, iPad, or&nbsp;Mac.

New

## iCloud+

### Powerful new features.

Plenty of storage.

When you upgrade to iCloud+ you’ll not only be able to choose the amount of storage that’s right for you, you’ll get an even more powerful and connected experience across your devices. It’s everything you already love about iCloud — along with enhanced privacy protections for web browsing and email and expanded HomeKit Secure Video&nbsp;support.

##### iCloud Private Relay
Beta

####
Browse like it’s nobody’s
 business. Because it&nbsp;isn’t.

iCloud&nbsp;Private&nbsp;Relay lets you browse with Safari on different networks in an even more secure and private way — whether that’s at home, a hotel, or a cafe. It’s designed so that websites, network providers, and even Apple can’t use your IP address, location, and browsing activity to create a detailed profile about&nbsp;you.
[4](#footnote-4)

##### Hide My Email

#### Keep your personal email address personal.

Instantly generate unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox — and even let you reply — so you don’t have to share your real email address when filling out a form on the web or signing up for a newsletter. You can create as many addresses as you need and disable them at any time, so you stay in control of your&nbsp;inbox.

##### HomeKit Secure Video

#### Keep an eye on your home. Keep other eyes&nbsp;out.

Connect your cameras with HomeKit Secure Video to record, analyze, and view your home security footage from anywhere. Footage is stored in an end-to-end encrypted format that only you, and the people you choose, can monitor. And none of that recorded video counts toward your iCloud storage, so you don’t have to give up space for the photos, files, backups, and other things you need&nbsp;most.

### Choose the plan that’s right for&nbsp;you.

All iCloud+ plans can be shared using Family Sharing. And iCloud+ is included with all Apple&nbsp;One plans at no additional&nbsp;cost.
