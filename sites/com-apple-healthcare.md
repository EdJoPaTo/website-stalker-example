# The future of healthcare

is in your hands.

Healthcare providers can deliver the best care when they have powerful, intuitive tools.  Our technology helps them work effectively within hospitals, connect remotely with patients, and conduct groundbreaking medical research. The result is care that becomes more efficient, more personalized, and ultimately more human.

## Apple in the hospital.

Our products transform the way doctors and nurses work with their patients. Apps on iPhone and iPad allow hospitals to work more efficiently. Clinicians to access health records and data right when they need them. Nurses to ensure better patient safety while administering medication. And patients to stay informed and engaged in their own care by communicating with their medical teams during hospital stays.
