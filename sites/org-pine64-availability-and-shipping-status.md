## Notices

Due to the ongoing severe component shortages, estimating availability of devices such as the Pinebook Pro or the PineTab is difficult. Estimated availability dates are
only approximations
. The one exception to this rule is the PinePhone, which we expect to be available all-year-round.

SBCs, SOMs, the PineTime, the Pinecil, the Pinecube and peripherals (inc. PinePower PSUs) will drift in-and-out of availability on a regular basis, as we will only sell stock that has only been delivered to our warehouse.

For more information about our strategy and reasoning pertaining to device and peripherals stock/ availability please read:
