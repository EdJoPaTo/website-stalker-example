Empower your patients with their health data.
==========

The Health app makes it easier than ever for users to be engaged in their health with ways to visualize, securely store, and share their health data. Your patients can aggregate their health records from multiple institutions alongside their patient-generated data, as well as share their health data with a provider to facilitate richer conversations.

Put your patients at the center of care.
----------

Enabling your patients to download their health records and share their health data with a provider can help them more actively participate in their health, as well help drive overall adoption of your patient portal.

### Engage your patients in their own health. ###

When your patients have their medical information organized into one view right on their iPhone, it can help them better understand their overall health and provide key elements of their medical history when visiting a new provider.

### Enable your clinicians to view their patients’ health data within their workflow. ###

To facilitate more informed conversations, your patients can choose to share certain data types from the Health app with their doctor at participating organizations. Clinicians can then review patient generated health data in an easy-to-read format within the organization’s electronic health records.

### Adding verifiable health records to the Health app. ###

Users around the world have an option for storing medical records of verifiable immunizations and test results directly in the Health app. If a vaccine provider or medical location supports the SMART Health Cards specification, it can allow your patients to download verifiable COVID-19 vaccination or test result records from an online browser or by scanning a QR code, so they can easily access them at any time.

### Complement your patient portal. ###

Connecting to the Health app has the potential to drive additional awareness and adoption of your patient portal and other services you offer because authentication through the Health app uses the same patient login credentials supported by your organization.

Keeping patients and healthcare providers connected, in a few simple steps.
----------

We’ve worked closely with multiple EHR vendors and others in the healthcare community to make it easy for you to enable these features.

### Built with industry standards. ###

Apple is using the SMART on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard which enables users to download their health records and share available health data with participating organizations. Downloadable data types include allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, and vitals. Data types for sharing with providers include exercise minutes, heart rate, blood pressure, lab results, and immunizations.

### Designed to protect privacy. ###

With Health Records on iPhone, your patients health data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Apple is providing a user the ability to request and download their health records utilizing a direct, encrypted connection between the user’s iPhone and the APIs provided by the health system or clinic. When your patients share Health app data with a provider, the data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and Apple cannot access or view any health data stored in connection with Health app data sharing with provider.

### Encrypted and secure throughout. ###

When health record data is transferred from a healthcare institution to the Health app through the Health Records feature, it is encrypted and does not traverse Apple’s network. When your patients share Health app data with a provider, the data is encrypted end-to-end with the healthcare organization. Apple does not maintain or have access to the encryption keys used to encrypt or decrypt a user’s health data.

### Creates a seamless connection. ###

Authentication uses the user’s patient portal credentials. The EHR connection leverages OAuth 2.0, which allows users to authenticate once and create an enduring connection to your EHR APIs. The Health app will periodically connect to your EHR APIs to download new health records. Sharing health data with a provider also uses this same OAuth 2.0 mechanism to establish a secure connection to your EHR. New health data is shared automatically, unless the user opts to stop sharing.
