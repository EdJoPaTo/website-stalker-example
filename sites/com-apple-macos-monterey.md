New experiences.
True connections.
----------

Staying in touch is more essential than ever. With SharePlay, you can watch together, listen together, and share your screen right inside FaceTime. FaceTime calls also sound and feel more natural. And Messages makes it even easier to find and enjoy the great content shared from friends and family.

### FaceTime ###

#### Introducing SharePlay ####

Keep FaceTime conversations going as you watch TV shows and movies, listen to music, or share your screen with SharePlay. It’s an entirely new way to have experiences with family and friends no matter the distance.

#### Watch together ####

Stream movies and TV shows while on a FaceTime call with friends. With synced playback and controls, you’ll see everyone laugh, jump, and react to the same moments at the same time. And the volume automatically adjusts, so you can keep talking while you watch.

More about Watch together

#### Watch together ####

Watch your favorite videos, movies, and TV shows in sync with friends. The following apps and streaming services will support SharePlay later this year.

#### Listen together ####

Get together and listen to an album with friends. The whole group can see what’s next and add songs to a shared queue with synced playback and easy‑to‑use controls.

#### Share your screen ####

Keep your FaceTime calls going while simultaneously sharing your whole screen or just a specific app. Collaborate with coworkers, have a game night with friends, or plan your next vacation as a group.

#### Spatial audio ####

Individual voices sound like they’re coming from the direction in which each person is positioned on your screen, helping conversations flow more naturally.

#### Mic modes ####

Voice Isolation minimizes background noise and puts your voice front and center. When the music or sounds around you are as important as what you have to say, Wide Spectrum leaves the ambient sound unfiltered.

More about Mic modes

#### Mic modes ####

With Voice Isolation, your mic uses machine learning to distinguish each sound it picks up, blocking ambient and distracting noises (like dogs barking or a TV in the next room) to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.

 Wide Spectrum lets your friends on FaceTime hear any and every sound happening where you are. It’s ideal for taking music lessons or for when you want someone to listen to what’s going on around you.

#### Grid view ####

Grid view shows people on your FaceTime call in the same‑size tiles, so you can have better conversations with a large group. The speaker is automatically highlighted so you always know who’s talking.

#### Portrait mode ####

Inspired by Portrait mode on iPhone and powered by the M1 chip, this new video effect puts the focus on you — not what’s behind you.

#### FaceTime links ####

Schedule and share FaceTime calls with a unique web link.

More about FaceTime links

#### FaceTime links ####

Make a unique FaceTime web link to easily set up a call for later or share the link with a group. Share it with your friends in Messages, Mail, or third‑party apps like WhatsApp. You can also generate a link for an event in Calendar, so everyone will know exactly where and when to meet.

#### Invite anyone to FaceTime ####

Now you can send friends and family a link to connect on FaceTime — even if they’re using Windows or Android. And it’s still end‑to‑end encrypted, so your call is as private and secure as any other FaceTime call.

### Messages ###

#### Shared with You ####

Now the links, images, and other content shared with you in Messages are featured in a new Shared with You section in the corresponding app. In Photos, Safari, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app, you can easily find shared content, see who recommended it, and reply right from the app you’re enjoying it from — without going back to Messages.

#### Photo collections ####

Multiple photos in Messages now appear as a collage or an elegant stack of images that you can flip through. Easily view them all as a grid, reply with a quick Tapback, or save them to your library.

Designed to help your work flow.
----------

The world’s fastest browser has a completely reimagined design, making Safari more immersive and customizable than ever. And with Quick Note and Focus, you’ve got new tools for keeping track of what’s important — and for clearing some headspace when you need it most.

### Safari ###

#### Compact tab bar ####

The compact tab bar option takes up less space on the page and takes on the color of the site you’re on, extending the web page to the edge of the window. Tabs have been combined with the Smart Search field, giving you access to powerful Safari features with the click of a tab.

#### Tab Groups ####

Save and organize your tabs in the way that works best for you. Name your Tab Groups, edit them, and switch between them as you go from one interest to the next. You can even drag your groups into an email and the links effortlessly appear as an easy‑to‑share list.

#### Access Tab Groups anywhere ####

Tab Groups seamlessly sync across your Apple devices, so you can easily pick back up whenever and wherever you want.

### Focus ###

#### Choose a Focus ####

Focus helps you stay in the moment when you need to concentrate or step away. Choose a Focus that only allows the notifications you want — you can get work done while you’re in the zone, or enjoy a distraction-free dinner. Pick from a list of suggested Focus options or create your own.

#### Signal your status ####

Stepping away is easier if others know you’re busy. So when you’re using Focus, your status will be automatically displayed in Messages. And for truly urgent messages, there’s still a way for people to notify you.

#### Across all your devices ####

Enable Focus on one of your devices and it’s automatically set across all of them.

### Quick Note and Notes ###

#### Introducing Quick Note ####

Notes is your go‑to app to capture any thought — and with the new Quick Note feature, you can jot down ideas no matter where you are or what you’re doing on your Mac. It’s like writing a note directly on whatever app you’re working in.

#### Put anything in a Quick Note ####

Add links, Safari highlights, tags, and mentions to a Quick Note, so you can get to important names, numbers, and ideas easily.

#### Finding your Quick Note is easy ####

In supported apps, you can add links to a Quick Note and a thumbnail of your note will always show up there when you go back. Quick Notes also appear together in the Notes app — whether you’re on your Mac, iPad, or iPhone.

#### Activity view and mentions ####

An all-new Activity view lets you see what others have added to your shared note. And you can notify members in shared notes with mentions. Just type someone’s name in a note to send them a notification.

#### Organize with tags ####

Tag a note using the # symbol and a keyword you can search, then find it later in the Tag Browser.

All Tags #California #Dogs #Hikes #Home #Projects #Trees #TV #Time #Vacation

Even better together.
In even more ways.
----------

Use your Mac and iPad together to unlock faster, easier, and amazingly creative ways to get things done — like never before. Universal Control makes connecting with your iPad instant and fluid. And now you can use AirPlay to add new dimensions of sharing and listening with Mac.

### Universal Control ###

#### One way to work across your devices ####

A single keyboard and mouse or trackpad now work seamlessly between your Mac and iPad — they’ll even connect to more than one Mac or iPad. Move your cursor from your Mac to your iPad, type on your Mac and watch the words show up on your iPad, or even drag and drop content from one Mac to another.

Beta

#### No setup required ####

Just put your devices next to each other and move your cursor seamlessly between them.

### AirPlay to Mac ###

#### Put it all on display ####

The power of AirPlay comes to Mac. Share, play, or present content from another Apple device to the big, beautiful screen of your Mac. You can also mirror or extend your display to pump up your productivity.

#### AirPlay speaker ####

Mac now works as an AirPlay speaker, so you can enjoy high-fidelity sound when you play music or podcasts from another device. It can even function as a secondary speaker to create multiroom audio.

Superpowers for getting things done.
----------

Introducing magical new ways to use your Mac. Bring all the information in your photos to life with Live Text and Visual Look Up. And use Shortcuts to streamline lengthy steps in workflows and everyday tasks.

### Live Text ###

#### Live Text in photos ####

Your Mac now lets you interact with text in any image. Click an address and it opens in Maps. Call, message, or save any phone number you see. You can copy and paste just as you would with any other text. And personal details and information from images never leave your device.

#### Visual Look Up ####

Quickly learn more about landmarks, works of art, dog breeds, and more with only a photo or an image you saw online.

### Shortcuts on Mac ###

#### Shortcuts app ####

Automate the things you do most often. Save time by turning something that would take multiple steps into just one, or connecting your go-to apps and services together with the Shortcuts editor. You can run them from your Dock, menu bar, the Finder, Spotlight, or even with Siri.

More about Shortcuts app

#### Shortcuts app ####

The future of Mac isn’t just bright — it’s intelligent. Shortcuts build on the capabilities of the Automator app. Now you can modernize and convert your existing Automator workflows into shortcuts.

#### Find the perfect shortcut ####

Browse through prebuilt shortcuts in the Shortcuts Gallery to find anything from making your own GIFs on the fly to cleaning up your Downloads folder.

##### Organize Downloads Folder #####

##### Make Meme #####

Pick an image, add your text, and you've got your own personalized meme.

##### Split Screen 2 Apps #####

Apps you frequently use together open side by side with a single click.

Replay Play

#### Make your own ####

Building a shortcut is a cinch with the editor. Just click and drag actions into the order you want them, and the editor suggests what action you should add next.

#### Share with a click ####

Sharing shortcuts with friends or online communities is as easy as sending a link. And after you receive one, simple prompts help you set permissions that keep you in control of which data is shared when you run it.

Your next adventure starts here.
----------

Exploration has never looked better. Maps delivers incredible new details that go beyond simply taking you from point A to point B. And Safari offers even more ways for you to explore online.

### Maps ###

#### All-new city experience ####

Explore cities with unprecedented detail for roads, neighborhoods, trees, buildings, and more. Visit amazing 3D landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge in both the day and dark mode maps.

#### Interactive globe ####

Privacy
----------

It’s more important than ever to know how your privacy is being protected. Get greater visibility into how and when apps access your mic. And keep senders from learning about your activity in Mail.

#### Recording indicator ####

Control Center lets you find out which apps have access to your mic. And you’ll see the new indicator on your screen whenever an app is accessing your microphone.

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Catch up on email with more peace of mind.

More about Mail Privacy Protection

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.

iCloud+
----------

iCloud has always kept your important information — like photos, documents, and notes — safe, up to date, and accessible across all your devices. Now iCloud+ takes that experience a step further, with an all-new subscription that will replace today’s storage plans.

### Introducing iCloud+ ###

Get everything you already love about iCloud — and new features including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support.

### iCloud Private Relay ###

Beta

Browse the web with more privacy.

More about iCloud Private Relay

### iCloud Private Relay ###

Beta

iCloud Private Relay is a service that lets you connect to virtually any network and browse with Safari in an even more secure and private way. It ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted and uses two separate internet relays so no one can use your IP address, location, and browsing activity to create a detailed profile about you.

### Hide My Email ###

Instantly generate unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox — so you don’t have to share your real email address when filling out a form on the web or signing up for a newsletter. Hide My Email is built into Mail, Safari, and iCloud Preferences.

And so much more.

### AirPods audio updates. ###

When you connect AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, or AirPods (3rd generation) to Mac models with the M1 chip, Spatial Audio and dynamic head tracking help deliver a theater‑like experience with sound that surrounds you. Sound stays fixed to the device even as you move your head. If you’re watching a movie, you’ll hear the engine roar right from the car, or hear dialogue straight from the actors’ mouths. With music, you’ll hear the mix exactly as intended.

### Low Power Mode. ###

Extend your MacBook battery life with Low Power Mode, which manages energy-intensive apps and processing. It directs power where you need it to get the most out of your battery.

### System-Wide Translation. ###

Translate text almost anywhere, even in many third party apps. Just highlight text, right‑click, and select Translate to immediately see the translation. With Live Text, you can even translate text in photos.

### Apple ID. ###

Account Recovery Contacts makes resetting your password and maintaining access to your account easier than ever. And a new Digital Legacy program lets you designate people as Legacy Contacts so they can access your account in the event of your death.
