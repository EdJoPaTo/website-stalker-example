Steam Deck™ is the most powerful, full-featured gaming handheld in the world.
----------

We partnered with AMD to create Steam Deck's custom APU, optimized for handheld gaming. It is a Zen 2 + RDNA 2 powerhouse, delivering more than enough performance to run the latest AAA games in a very efficient power envelope.

#### Comfort ####

The Steam Deck was built for extended play sessions—whether you're using thumbsticks or trackpads—with full-size controls positioned perfectly within your reach. The rear of the device is sculpted to comfortably fit a wide range of hand sizes.

#### Thumbsticks ####

Best-in-class thumbsticks—with capacitive touch sensors built-in—provide a level of precision and comfort not found in other portable gaming devices.

#### Triggers ####

Analog triggers provide a full range of input for the best experience—especially in driving games.

#### Grip buttons ####

Four user-assignable buttons on the back of the Deck put the next level of control right at your fingertips while keeping your thumb firmly planted on the trackpad or stick.

#### 7" touchscreen ####

Type and swipe through the Steam UI with Deck's capacitive multi-touch display.

#### Trackpads ####

Play PC games that were never designed to be handheld. With increased precision and customizability, trackpads also give you a competitive edge when playing fast paced FPS games.

#### Gyro ####

With an IMU and capacitive touch thumbsticks on-board, Deck helps you aim better. By physically positioning the device you can achieve more precision than using a thumbstick or trackpad alone.

Everything you need
----------

#### Fast storage ####

Get the built-in storage you need: 64GB eMMC, 256GB NVMe SSD (faster), or 512GB NVMe SSD (fastest). If you're looking for more space, augment your built-in storage with a microSD card and fill it up with even more games.

#### Hi-Fi audio ####

Steam Deck's stereo speakers pack a punch. An embedded DSP provides clarity and a wide soundstage for an immersive listening experience. Connect your favorite headset, or use the onboard dual microphones to chat with your friends.

#### 40Wh battery ####

Steam Deck's onboard 40 watt-hour battery provides several hours of play time for most games. For lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing, you can expect to get the maximum battery life of approximately 7-8 hours.

#### Expandable I/O ####

The single USB-C jack is multi-purpose: used for charging, peripherals, or even throwing the game onto a big screen at the same time. Any USB-C hub can be used to expand your options, or get our Steam Deck™ Docking Station when it is released. More info on the dock below.

#### Wireless ####

WiFi keeps you connected to the world, and Bluetooth allows for a wide variety of wireless peripherals - from controllers to headsets, keyboards, and mice.

#### Fast Suspend / Resume ####

We’ve built a quick suspend / resume feature into SteamOS. Press the power button, and Steam Deck will suspend your game and go into sleep mode. Push the power button again and it will wake up right where you left off.

Expand your Library with a microSD card
----------

All models of Steam Deck support expanding your storage via microSD cards. Games stored on a microSD card will appear in your library instantly.

Use your Deck as a PC.
Because it is one.
----------

#### Plays nice with all your accessories ####

Steam Deck is Bluetooth-ready, and its USB-C port can handle all sorts of I/O. Want to have a fighting tournament on the go? Covered. Want to play with Bluetooth mouse and keyboard? Covered. Want to pair your favorite Bluetooth headphones? You're good to go.

#### Deck can be plugged in to your TV ####

Deck can be plugged in to your TV, monitor, or even your old CRT if you have the right cables. When docked, the Steam Deck’s USB-C port can carry video, audio, input, etc. Just plug in your peripherals, or use the docking station, and you’re ready to go.

There’s a dock, too.
----------

The Steam Deck™ Docking Station props up your Steam Deck while connecting to external displays, wired networking, USB peripherals, and power. You can also use a powered USB-C hub, if you've got one lying around.

The official dock will be sold separately. Add it to your Steam wishlist to get notified when it's available to order.

Designed for the long game
----------

Our design story began with a known inventory of controls, to accommodate long play sessions through the breadth of games available on Steam. The rest was up for exploration. The result: a purposeful and balanced design tailored for your hands.

WRONG! (Ouch.)

I think we can put our differences
behind us… for science… you monster.

Aw, an input panda!

You can learn a lot with just hot glue and tape.
