					The minimal images generally contain no software other than SSH, giving you a more freedom to adapt things to your usecase.
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						LAMP
					</a>
					images contain "Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP".
				</p>
				<p>
					You can find more information on how to install these operating systems on your server on
					<a href="/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage" rel="noopener noreferrer">

				<h2>
					What changes are made to the distributions?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our standard images generally contain no additional or modified drivers or other software (eg. for RAID controllers). Our support teams update the images regularly.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Software
				</h3>
				<p>
					Each image contains software for all available installation options (software RAID and LVM) and file systems (ext2/3/4, reiserfs, xfs).
				</p>
				<h3>
					Boot loader
				</h3>
				<p>
					GRUB2 is the preferred boot loader and is used when it is supported by the operating system tools (like YAST). Otherwise GRUB (GRUB legacy) is used. The usage of LILO is no longer supported.
				</p>
				<p>
					The boot loader configuration is adjusted so that any graphics mode is disabled
					<code>
						nomodeset
					</code>
					.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Network
				</h3>
				<p>
					The network configuration is pre-configured so that there are no restrictions. No firewall is enabled by default, but we recommend our users enable one as part of their system setup.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Drives/RAID
				</h3>
				<p>
					If software RAID is used, the RAID verification is set to a random time.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Time (NTP/Chrony/systemd-timesyncd)
				</h3>
				<p>
					The configuration is adjusted so that the Hetzner NTP servers are used. The preference is to use systemd-timesyncd if available, as it provides a strict client mode.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Package repositories
				</h3>
				<p>
					Provided that Hetzner has a mirror of the distribution, this gets used by default and is pre-configured, along with another mirror.
