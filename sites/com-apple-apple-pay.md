## Here to pay.

Apple Pay is the one way to pay. It replaces your

physical cards

and cash with an easier, safer, more

secure, and private payment method&nbsp;— whether you’re

in a store, online, or sending cash to friends or family.

It’s money, made&nbsp;modern.

Apple Pay is already on your device.
Apple&nbsp;Pay is built into iPhone, Apple&nbsp;Watch, Mac, and iPad. No&nbsp;separate app to download. No&nbsp;complicated processes to complete. No&nbsp;hassles.

Use Apple Cash with Apple&nbsp;Pay.
Apple&nbsp;Pay powers Apple&nbsp;Cash, which works a lot like a debit card and lets you send and receive money right in Messages. Just set up your Apple&nbsp;Cash card in the Wallet app and send money to your squad for brunch&nbsp;— or ask them to pay you&nbsp;back.

you check&nbsp;out.

At stores and more.
Apple&nbsp;Pay is accepted at over 85 percent of retailers in the U.S., so you can likely use it wherever and however you want. If you’re not sure, just ask. Apple&nbsp;Pay works anywhere that takes contactless payments — from vending machines and grocery stores to taxis and subway&nbsp;stations.

Online and in apps.
Use Apple&nbsp;Pay for purchases in Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can skip the lengthy checkout forms and pay with just a touch or a glance. Or use Apple&nbsp;Pay to subscribe to services like Apple&nbsp;Music, Apple&nbsp;News+, and Apple&nbsp;TV+, buy apps and games on the App&nbsp;Store, and upgrade your iCloud&nbsp;storage.

## Safe and

sound.

And&nbsp;secure.

Personal data. Protected.
When you make a purchase, Apple&nbsp;Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with&nbsp;merchants.

Your purchases stay private.
When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple&nbsp;Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to&nbsp;you. And when you use Apple&nbsp;Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.

Tap more. Touch less.
Apple&nbsp;Pay works right from your device, helping you avoid touching buttons and terminals, handling cards, and exchanging cash. So you keep your hands clean and are less likely to pick up&nbsp;— and spread — germs.

### How secure is Apple&nbsp;Pay?

Apple Pay is safer than using a physical credit, debit, or prepaid card. Face&nbsp;ID, Touch&nbsp;ID, or your passcode are required for purchases on your iPhone, Apple&nbsp;Watch, Mac, or iPad. Your card number and identity aren’t shared with merchants, and your actual card numbers aren’t stored on your device or on Apple&nbsp;servers.

When you pay in stores, neither Apple nor your device will send your actual card number to merchants. When you pay online in Safari or in apps, the merchant will only receive information you authorize to fulfill your order — such as your name, email address, and billing and shipping&nbsp;addresses.

When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple&nbsp;Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory&nbsp;purposes.
