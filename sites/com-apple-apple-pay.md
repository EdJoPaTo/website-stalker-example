Apple Pay
==========

Here to pay.
----------

Apple Pay is the one way to pay. It replaces your
physical cards
and cash with an easier, safer, more
secure, and private payment method — whether you’re
in a store, online, or sending cash to friends or family.
It’s money, made modern.

Setup in seconds. Apple Pay is simple to set up. Just add your credit or debit card to the Wallet app on your iPhone and you’re ready to go. You still get all your card’s rewards and benefits — so you won’t miss out on any hard-earned points or miles.

Apple Pay is already on your device. Apple Pay is built into iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, and iPad. No separate app to download. No complicated processes to complete. No hassles.

Use Apple Cash with Apple Pay. Apple Pay powers Apple Cash, which works a lot like a debit card and lets you send and receive money right in Messages. Just set up your Apple Cash card in the Wallet app and send money to your squad for brunch — or ask them to pay you back.

At stores and more. Apple Pay is accepted at over 85 percent of retailers in the U.S., so you can likely use it wherever and however you want. If you’re not sure, just ask. Apple Pay works anywhere that takes contactless payments — from vending machines and grocery stores to taxis and subway stations.

Online and in apps. Use Apple Pay for purchases in Safari on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can skip the lengthy checkout forms and pay with just a touch or a glance. Or use Apple Pay to subscribe to services like Apple Music, Apple News+, and Apple TV+, buy apps and games on the App Store, and upgrade your iCloud storage.

Safe and
 sound.

 And secure.
----------

Personal data. Protected. When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or on Apple servers. And when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.

Your purchases stay private. When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple Pay doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.

Tap more. Touch less. Apple Pay works right from your device, helping you avoid touching buttons and terminals, handling cards, and exchanging cash. So you keep your hands clean and are less likely to pick up — and spread — germs.

* ### How do I use Apple Pay?  ###

  You can use Apple Pay to make purchases in stores, on websites, and in apps. It’s widely accepted, simple, safe, secure, and private.

  * [Learn how to use Apple Pay in apps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201239#inapp)

* ### How secure is Apple Pay?  ###

  Apple Pay is safer than using a physical credit, debit, or prepaid card. Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode are required for purchases on your iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, or iPad. Your card number and identity aren’t shared with merchants, and your actual card numbers aren’t stored on your device or on Apple servers.

  When you pay in stores, neither Apple nor your device will send your actual card number to merchants. When you pay online in Safari or in apps, the merchant will only receive information you authorize to fulfill your order — such as your name, email address, and billing and shipping addresses.

  When you pay with a debit or credit card, Apple doesn’t keep transaction information that can be tied back to you. And when you use Apple Cash, information is stored only for troubleshooting, fraud prevention, and regulatory purposes.

  Apple Pay works in countries and regions that support contactless payments. Confirm with your bank, and ask about any fees they may charge for overseas usage.
