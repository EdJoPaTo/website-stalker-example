## HTML5 Tests

## BigBlueButton Puppeteer Tests

Tests for BigBlueButton using Puppeteer, Chromium and Jest.

## Get BBB URL and Secret and configure .env file

To run these tests with an existing BigBlueButton server, make sure you have a server set up, and that you have the serverâ€™s URL and secret. These will be the same URL and secret you would use to make API calls to the server. If you do not have these, you can find them by running
bbb-conf --secret
from the terminal in the server.

Copy the
.env-template
file to a new file, and name it
.env
. In the
.env
file, add your BigBlueButton server URL and secret, so the tests will know which server to connect to.

## Setup

To run these tests, you will need the following:

- Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- Node.js 8.11.4 or later
- Docker

These instructions assume you have the BigBlueButton repository cloned into a directory named
bigbluebutton
.

First, you need to have the dependencies installed with
meteor npm install
, from the
bigbluebutton-html5
directory. When Puppeteer installs, it will automatically install the Chromium browser in which the tests will run.

To run individual tests, you can also optionally install Jest globally with
sudo npm install jest -g
.

$
cd
tests/puppeteer
$
npm
install

## Running the tests with an existing BigBlueButton server (All in one)

To run all the tests at once, run
npm test
.

## Running a single test with an existing BigBlueButton server (Specific test)

To run a specific test from
bash
:

$
./tests/puppeteer/run.sh
-t
testcase

Test cases list:
webcamlayout/whiteboard/webcam/virtualizedlist/user/sharednotes/screenshare/presentation/notifications/customparameters/chat/breakout/audio
.

If you have Jest installed globally, you can run individual tests with
jest TEST [TEST...]
. The tests are found in the
.test.js
files, but you may choose to omit file extensions when running the tests.

## Debugging, Metrics and Evidences

### Debugging

To debug the tests, you will need to set
DEBUG=true
; if
DEBUG
receives
true
, the logs will show in the console from which we start the tests.

Debugging output will look like below:

console.log

### Getting Metrics

To run the tests and get their metrics, you will need to set
BBB_COLLECT_METRICS=true
; if
BBB_COLLECT_METRICS
receives
true
, the metrics will be generated at the end of the test inside
/data/test-date-testName/metrics
folder; for example:
data/test-19-01-2021-pollResultsChatMessage/metrics
.

### Getting Evidences

Generating evidences is about to take screenshots of the client during testing. And to realize this, assigning
GENERATE_EVIDENCES
in
.env
to
true
. This will take screenshots and save them in
data/test-date-testName/screenshots
; for example:
data/test-19-01-2021-pollResultsChatMessage/screenshots
.

## Visual Regression

Our test suite includes visual regression specs that can be execute separately with
npm run test-visual-regression
(desktop only). It will take screenshots of various views and components of the client, save them inside the
tests/puppeteer/__image_snapshots__
folder and put the failed cases into
tests/puppeteer/__image_snapshots__/__diff_output__
.
