*See the plan*

Behind every Apple product is a plan for the future.
----------

Our goal of making products with net zero carbon impact by 2030 goes hand in hand with our commitment to those most affected by climate change — and to global communities who are finding solutions and taking inclusive action to fight it.

### Low-carbon design ###

We’re designing carbon impact out of our products by increasing recycled content, using material more efficiently, and reducing the amount of energy they use.

### Energy efficiency ###

We’re finding more ways to increase energy efficiency across all our retail stores, data centers, offices, and manufacturing sites.

### Renewable electricity ###

Our corporate operations already run on 100% renewable electricity generated from solar, wind, and other renewable sources. By 2030, clean energy will be used to make every Apple product and will account for customers’ product energy use as well.

### Avoiding direct emissions ###

We’re finding solutions for manufacturing and shipping materials, components, and products in ways that reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions.

### Carbon removal ###

By investing in nature, we’re working to remove carbon from the atmosphere to address the emissions we can’t yet avoid, while also supporting local communities and restoring biodiversity.

### Designing to leave the world better than we found it. ###

### The fight against climate change is a fight for economic equality. ###

Find out why

#### Climate solutions can help dismantle systemic barriers. ####

Communities of color often bear the greatest impact of climate change. Environmental solutions can help advance equity for these communities. In July 2020, Apple announced the inaugural Impact Accelerator program to support 15 Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses at the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy to champion equity and opportunity in the environmental sector. As part of Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), this program helps combat systemic barriers to opportunity while advancing innovative solutions for communities most affected by climate change. The businesses are based across the United States — from Silicon Valley in California, to Detroit, Michigan, to tribal nations in the Midwest — and are driving innovation in energy efficiency, solar, green chemistry, recycling, and other environmental areas. Many are focused on bringing clean energy, opportunity, and vital services to vulnerable and underserved communities. The three-month Impact Accelerator program includes one-on-one mentorship with Apple experts on topics like renewable energy and responsible sourcing. By connecting innovators, both in our inaugural class and at Apple, we’re creating more opportunities for progress in our shared goals. The next cohort of Impact Accelerator participants will start in fall 2022.

### Using electricity from renewable sources to make Apple Products  ###

Find out why

#### Clean energy is
 no longer optional. ####

The emissions from manufacturing our products account for about 70% of our carbon footprint. By transitioning to clean energy across our supply chain, we can erase the majority of that footprint. Since 2015 Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program has helped our manufacturing suppliers switch to renewable electricity generated from solar, wind, and other renewable projects. In 2021 the renewable energy online in our supply chain generated 18.3 million megawatt-hours of clean energy, avoiding almost 14 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Today 213 suppliers have committed to 100% renewable electricity for Apple production, representing the majority of Apple’s direct worldwide spending for materials, manufacturing, and assembly of products. And by 2030, every Apple product will be made with 100% clean energy.

### Our products use less power. That’s powerful. ###

Find out why

#### Energy-saving products reduce our carbon footprint. And yours. ####

The electricity our customers use to power their Apple devices makes up 22% of our carbon footprint and affects the carbon footprint of each customer. Designing products that require less energy is one of the major ways we can lower their carbon impact, even as they’re being used. Software and power-efficient components in our devices intelligently manage the amount of power they consume. Apple devices consistently rank among the high-performing products rated by ENERGY STAR®. And the transition to Apple silicon in Mac computers has significantly increased product energy efficiency — Mac mini consumes up to 60% less energy while in active use than the previous generation. Innovations in energy efficiency in one product can influence those in another. When you multiply these improvements by all the Apple devices in the world, you’ll see the difference it can make.

more recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt used in our products in 2021

less single-use plastic in packaging compared with 2015

### One *less*  thing. ###

Find out why

#### Fewer chargers mean less environmental impact. ####

Power adapters use the largest amounts of certain materials, including plastic, copper, tin, and zinc. By removing them from iPhone 12 packaging, we estimate that we avoided mining over 550,000 metric tons of copper, tin, and zinc ore. Using smaller, lighter packaging lets us fit up to 70% more iPhone boxes per shipping pallet, which helps further reduce our carbon footprint. Eliminating power adapters from device packaging lets us avoid more than 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 500,000 cars from the road for a year. Leaving out those adapters was a bold change for Apple and a necessary one for our planet.

### Siri runs on clean energy. Any questions?*Siri*  runs on clean energy. Any questions?  ###

Find out how

#### Apple services and features are powered by renewable electricity. ####

Our data centers are filled with servers that help run your favorite Apple apps and services like Siri, iMessage, and iCloud. These facilities also represent our largest corporate energy loads, which is why we use 100% renewable electricity to power them. Our servers are powered by high-efficiency power supplies, which means they are able to work while using less energy overall. So no matter how many questions you ask Siri, every answer will be as clean as the last.

### We’re investing in some wild ideas for carbon removal. ###

Find out why

#### Nature can help us get to neutral. ####

We’re striving to bring our emissions down as low as possible. But there are some emissions we can’t yet avoid. To remove unavoidable carbon emissions from the atmosphere, we are starting with nature-based solutions. With Conservation International (CI) and Goldman Sachs, we created the $200 million Restore Fund to make investments in natural climate solutions while seeking to generate a financial return. The world’s forests, wetlands, and grasslands have an important role to play in achieving global climate targets. We’re already working with CI to naturally restore the degraded savannas of the Chyulu Hills in Kenya, demonstrate innovative new models with 27,000 acres of mangrove forest in coastal Colombia, and conserve the Amazon rainforest from loss in the Rio Nieva Reserve Zone of northern Peru. Through the Restore Fund, we’re aiming to remove at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. All of these efforts combined will help sequester carbon, restore ecosystems, and engage local and Indigenous communities while helping us along the way to our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality.

### It takes guts
to erase our footprint.  ###

Find out why

#### Using recycled materials lowers the carbon impact of our products. ####

Our goal is to one day make every Apple product with 100% recycled or renewable materials. To achieve that, we need to design devices to use more recycled content and make sure these materials get recovered when products reach end-of-life. When we use recycled and renewable materials, we lower our reliance on mining, shipping, and processing raw materials, thereby reducing our carbon footprint and conserving precious natural resources. Aluminum is one of our most widely used materials, and it represented over a quarter of our product manufacturing footprint in 2015. So we developed a 100% recycled alloy that still meets our high standards for performance and durability. All iPad models in our lineup, including the new iPad Air, use 100% recycled aluminum in their enclosures — joining Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and the 14‑inch and 16‑inch MacBook Pro models. Aluminum now makes up less than 10% of our product manufacturing footprint.

Every Apple product contains materials that can be used to build new ones. And research from our Material Recovery Lab in Texas helps us reclaim more of those building blocks with innovative tools and technologies. Daisy and Dave, our disassembly robots, take apart iPhone devices and components to recover crucial materials like gold, cobalt, steel, and tungsten. These collected materials make it back to the raw materials marketplace so that we, and others, can use recycled materials for the next generation of products.

### Creating positive impact with clean energy. ###

Find out how

#### Clean energy benefits our company, commun­ities, and the environ­ment. ####

As Apple continues the journey to becoming fully carbon neutral by 2030, we’re also focusing our efforts on democratizing access to renewable electricity around the world. Since 2019 our Power for Impact program has funded projects with clear carbon, ecological, and social benefits, giving local communities and organizations access to cost-effective energy while we retain the environmental attributes of each project. Solar projects in the Philippines, Thailand, Nigeria, Vietnam, Colombia, Israel, and South Africa help provide cost-effective energy to communities facing energy challenges. Recently Apple brought renewable energy to over 3500 South African households that previously lacked access. We are also helping to reduce electricity costs for the Pioneer School for the Visually Impaired by funding rooftop solar panel installations at three schools across South Africa. And in October 2021 we announced a partnership with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, a 500-megawatt clean energy project put forward by six Sioux tribes in the Dakotas, to develop tribal renewable energy resources for the wholesale market. This project will support a large-scale wind power development in the Midwest. We’re continuing to find more ways to expand access to clean, affordable energy solutions around the world, empowering people and progress one renewable energy project at a time.
