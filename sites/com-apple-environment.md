    #### Our plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. ####

    **Designing for low carbon.** We’re making products with more recycled materials and working to reduce the amount of energy these devices use.

    **Increasing energy efficiency.** We’re using energy more efficiently across retail stores, offices, data centers, and manufacturing sites.

    **Using renewable energy.** We’re committed to transitioning our entire manufacturing supply chain to 100% renewable electricity generated from solar, wind, and other renewable projects.

    **Avoiding direct emissions.** We’re innovating the processes in our facilities and supply chain to avoid greenhouse gas emissions.

    **Investing in nature-based solutions.** We’re investing in working forests and ecosystem restoration in ways that respect communities and remove carbon from the atmosphere.

    ### Using electricity from renewable sources to make Apple Products ###

    Find out why

    #### Clean energy is
     no longer optional. ####

    The biggest part of our carbon footprint comes from the electricity used to build the products you love. By switching to clean energy across our supply chain, we can erase the majority of that footprint. Since 2015, Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program has helped our manufacturing suppliers transition to renewable electricity generated from solar, wind, and other renewable projects. And by 2030, all our products will be made with 100% clean energy.

    110+More than 110 Apple suppliers have committed to clean energy.

    4GWWe’ve added over 4 gigawatts of renewable electricity online to our supply chain.

    8.6MMTRenewable energy brought online to our supply chain has helped avoid over 8 million metric tons of carbon emissions.

    ### In the fight against climate change, every voice matters. ###

    Find out why

    #### Climate solutions can help dismantle systemic barriers. ####

    Communities of color around the world often bear the greatest impact of climate change. But environmental solutions can help advance equity for these communities. Apple’s Impact Accelerator supports Black- and Brown‑owned businesses and innovations that can also drive positive outcomes in our supply chain. The Impact Accelerator is part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), which focuses on efforts that address education, economic equality, and criminal justice reform in the United States. REJI’s Impact Accelerator can help bring opportunity to Black and Brown businesses while creating innovative solutions to climate change.

    ### iPhone has guts. ###

    Find out more

    #### iPhone is 100% committed to using 100% recycled materials. ####

    iPhone relies on the availability of high-quality materials. Our goal is to one day source all of these valuable resources only from renewable and recycled alternatives. We’ve recently transitioned to 100% recycled gold in the plating of the main logic board and the wire in the front camera and rear cameras. We now use 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, 100% recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine, and 100% recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board and battery management unit. We’ve also redesigned the packaging to create an unboxing experience that’s better for the environment, and just as delightful for you.

    90%iPhone 13 packaging uses 90% less plastic than iPhone 6s packaging.

    2.6MMT2.6 million metric tons of mined rock equivalent have been avoided by using recycled content in iPhone 13.

    ### Our products use less power. That’s powerful. ###

    Find out why

    #### Energy-saving products reduce our carbon footprint. And yours. ####

    Product energy use makes up 19% of our carbon footprint and affects the carbon footprint of each customer. Designing products that require less energy is one of the major ways we can lower their carbon impact, even as they’re being used. Innovations in energy efficiency in one product can influence another. When you multiply these improvements by all the Apple devices in the world, you’ll see the difference it can make.

    70%In 12 years, we’ve reduced average product energy use by more than 70%.

    63%iPad (9th generation) consumes 63% less energy than the ENERGY STAR® requirement.

    ### We’re investing in some wild ideas for carbon removal. ###

    Find out how

    #### Nature can help us get to neutral. ####

    Apple strives to bring our emissions down as low as possible. But there are some emissions we can’t yet avoid. To remove unavoidable carbon emissions from the atmosphere, we are looking to nature‑based solutions. With Conservation International (CI) and Goldman Sachs, we have created the $200 million Restore Fund to make investments in natural climate solutions while seeking to generate a financial return. The world’s forests, wetlands, and grasslands have an important role to play in achieving global climate targets. We’re already working with CI to naturally restore the degraded savannas of the Chyulu Hills in Kenya, demonstrate innovative new models with mangroves in coastal Colombia, and protect more Amazon rainforest from loss in the Rio Nieva Reserve Zone of northern Peru. All of these efforts combined will help sequester carbon and restore ecosystems while helping us along the way to our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality.

    2BOver 2 billion acres of restored savanna can remove hundreds of millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year.

    94K94,000 acres have been added to Peru’s Alto Mayo Protected Area.

    27K27,000 acres of restored mangrove forest can store up to 1 million metric tons of carbon over its lifetime.

    ### iMac brings us closer to net zero. ###

    Find out how

    #### iMac is designed to take carbon out of the equation. ####

    We design our products to have a lighter environmental footprint. The 24‑inch iMac is evidence. Not only is its enclosure made with low-carbon aluminum, but it also uses recycled plastic, recycled tin, and recycled rare earth elements. The M1 chip, now in the 24‑inch iMac, is the first chip designed specifically for Mac. M1 is designed to run tasks as efficiently as possible, delivering outstanding performance while using significantly less power. This change, along with our efforts to use recycled and low‑carbon materials, has decreased the carbon footprint of iMac by about 20% compared with the previous generation.

    ### One *less* thing. ###

    Find out why

    #### Fewer chargers mean less environmental impact. ####

    Power adapters use the largest amounts of certain materials, including plastic, copper, tin, and zinc. Since removing them from iPhone and Apple Watch packaging, we’ve avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth, and we’ve eliminated the emissions that come from processing and transporting them. Using smaller, lighter packaging lets us ship more boxes at once, which helps reduce our carbon footprint. Leaving out adapters was a bold change for Apple, and a necessary one for our planet.

    861K861,000 metric tons of copper, tin, and zinc ore are expected to be saved by removing power adapters.

    ### *Siri* runs on clean energy. Any questions? ###

    Find out how

    #### Apple services are powered by renewable electricity. ####

    Our data centers are filled with servers that help run your favorite Apple apps and services like Siri, iMessage, and iCloud. These facilities also represent our largest corporate energy loads, which is why we use 100% renewable electricity to power them. So no matter how many questions you ask Siri, every answer will be as clean as the last.

    ### *100%* recycled aluminum.*1000%* here for it. ###

    Find out how

    #### Using recycled aluminum in devices lowers their carbon impact. And yours. ####

    Many Apple products use aluminum as a primary material. It’s strong and durable, and it helps your devices last longer. While all Apple devices with aluminum enclosures contain some recycled aluminum, making every product carbon neutral by 2030 means incorporating even more recycled content. To achieve this, we’ve engineered our own 100% recycled aluminum alloy that can be recycled indefinitely while maintaining performance and durability. It has allowed us to transition to using 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures of many devices. And when we have to use virgin aluminum, we work with our suppliers to source aluminum smelted primarily with low-carbon sources of electricity, like hydroelectricity, further reducing our carbon footprint.

    100%MacBook Air, Apple Watch, Mac mini, and all iPad devices use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosures.

    72%Since 2015, we’ve decreased our carbon emissions associated with aluminum by 72%.

    ### *Daisy* wants a piece of your iPhone. ###

    Find out why

    #### Recycled iPhone materials are the building blocks for new devices. ####

    Every Apple product contains materials that can be used to build new products. And research from our Material Recovery Lab in Texas is helping us reclaim more of those building blocks with transformative tools and technologies. Our own disassembly robots, Daisy and Dave, take apart iPhone devices and components to enable the recovery of materials like rare earth elements, steel, and tungsten. These materials make it back to the raw materials marketplace so that we, and others, can use recycled materials for the next generation of products.

    1MT1 metric ton of iPhone components removed by Daisy contains as much gold and copper as 150 metric tons of mined ore.

    39K39,000 metric tons of e-waste were diverted from landfills in 2020.

    200/hrDaisy can recover materials from 15 different iPhone models at a rate of 200 devices per hour.

    #### Clean energy works best when shared. ####

    Now that Apple Inc. runs on 100% clean energy, we’ve turned our efforts to democratizing access to renewable electricity around the world. Since 2019, our Power for Impact program has funded projects with clear carbon, ecological, and social benefits. Solar projects in the Philippines, Thailand, and South Africa help provide cost-effective clean energy to us and to communities facing energy access challenges. And this year we announced our investment in the world’s largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark. We’re powering people and progress one renewable energy project at a time.

    152kW152 kilowatts of solar power and 830 kilowatt hours of storage systems in Diepsloot, South Africa, deliver power to 3600 households.

    90%90% of the renewable energy for Apple facilities comes from Apple‑created projects.

    20KApple’s wind turbines in Esbjerg, Denmark, produce enough energy each year to power almost 20,000 homes.

    ### Apple Inc. Officially in the green. ###

    Find out how

    #### We’ve made it our business to be 100% carbon neutral. ####

    In April 2020, Apple achieved the exciting milestone of becoming 100% carbon neutral across all of our corporate operations. A big part of this achievement was transitioning in 2018 to 100% renewable electricity in all the retail stores you visit and the Apple data centers that run your devices. We’re taking our commitment to green technologies even further by investing in the development of new renewables around the world. And to help address emissions that we can’t avoid now, we’ve partnered with Conservation International on projects that protect and restore grasslands, wetlands, and forests.

    4.6MMTIn 2020, over 4.6 million metric tons of emissions from corporate operations were avoided.

    73%Since 2011, scope 1 and 2 emissions have been reduced by 73%.

    There’s always more to do.

    * ### Apple’s commitment to water runs deep. ###

      Find out how

      #### Using water wisely, wherever we are. ####

      Water is a precious resource. It’s also a community resource, which is why we’re committed to reducing, reusing, and returning as much water as possible to the local environments where we work. Our operations use water in many different ways, from relatively low‑impact retail stores to data centers and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, which rely more heavily on water for cooling and processing. We’re taking several steps to reduce our water impact, starting with selecting the right sites and designing for water efficiency and reuse. We’re also expanding our use of alternative water sources like recycled water, rainwater, and condensate. Finally, we are engaging with external stakeholders in the places we operate to ensure that our water stewardship plans meet local shared water challenges.

      #### Paper packaging you can feel good about. ####

      We have successfully closed the loop on our paper supply chain. Since 2017, 100% of the wood fiber in our paper and packaging comes from recycled or responsible sources. When virgin fiber is needed, we source wood from responsibly managed forests. Through partnership with The Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we have protected and improved the management of over one million acres of working forests in the United States and China. And when forests thrive, so do local communities and wildlife.

    * ### Durability you could
