Photos
----------

### iCloud Shared Photo Library ###

Share photos and videos seamlessly with up to five other people, so everyone can collaborate on the family’s collection and enjoy more complete memories. With iCloud Shared Photo Library, family memories are in one place for everyone to enjoy at any time, even if you’re not the one who snapped the shot or edited the photo.

### Smart ways to share ###

Choose what to include based on a start date or the people in the photos. Once the shared library is set up, you can share photos manually, or get smart suggestions for adding photos to the shared library in For You.

### Edits and changes sync everywhere ###

Everyone has equal permissions for adding, editing, and deleting photos in the shared library. Favorites, captions, and keywords sync too, so if one person organizes the collection, everyone benefits.

Messages
