It's me.

Hello, it's me, Bennet!

 I like Nordstrand. It's so calm and beautiful. My significant other and I camped in my (beloved) car on top of the dyke for a night, when this picture was taken (in Q1 2021).

 I'm learning swedish using duolingo for quite a while now. It's fun!

 Baking bread has recently become one of my hobbies. Well, I had a lot of time at home, alone, with an oven. Thanks COVID-19, I guess?

 Thanks to the iPad Air & Sharpr3D, I find a ton of pleasure in designing 3D CAD models. This picture shows an enclosure for a camera. I imagine it to withstand a lot of pressure when submerged deep into the ocean. Maybe I should calculate the pressure rating one day?

 GitHub is my favorite platform to manage my own software projects. But I prefer to use GitHub to collaborate with others. I regularly open issues and pullrequests on various open source projects. I'm especially fond of the XboxDev community projects (mainly nxdk). From the other supporters I learned a lot, especially about clang/LLVM, make and How-To git (with a considerable quality).

 Do you know Bill Nye? If not, shame on you.
He's brilliant!
 I'm a huge fan of his work especially in the more recent time. Not long ago, I finished listening to his audio book "Undeniable" - Absolutly recommend getting it. The picture, that's him by the way, is taken from the presskit on his website.
 It's not magic, it's

SCIENCE!

 I love Sweden! In Q1 2020, I had the pleasure of meeting up with the swedish hacker dracc for a coffee (and to buy about 20 game-consoles, ooops). The trip was rather short, only three nights but damn! Do I love Sweden's landscape!

 I love cows! They are just so cute! Owning four cows as a pet is one of my favourite dreams, maybe one day... :)
 And please stop eating them, please?

 Driving is, ahem, not the smartest move in the current (and probably coming) decade. And yet, I can't help but deeply enjoy driving. I've driven just about every kind of vehicle to date. I've even driven quay cranes that weigh about 2600 tons (I somehow doubt they count as cars tho ;3). At least I am a practiced driver with a lot of caution.

 I have been to Norway so many times, I stopped counting. It is an incredible country, with breathtaking beauty and so much tranquility. I don't know any other place in the world that is as magical and yet modern as Norway.

 Plants are very good companions. I have so many houseplants, I can't count them. No kidding! Avocados, monstera (different varieties), ivies, tomatoes, spiderplants, peace lilies, snakeplants and many many more! Caring for houseplants is a great hobby. Would highly recommend.
 Oh, you ask what kind of ball this is? That my dear reader is a shade ball. I got it as a Patreon supporter from Veritasium (Derek Muller). Would also highly recommend that YouTube channel (there you will also find a video explaining what a shade ball is and what it is for).

 This beautiful painting was painted for me by my significant other. Jellyfish are one of my particularly favorite animals. Did you know that there is a jellyfish species with 24 eyes?
