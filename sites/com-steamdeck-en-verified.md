See at a glance how games will play on Steam Deck.
----------

With Steam Deck, we're bringing your Steam Library to a new form factor—a portable gaming PC. While many games run great on Deck out of the box, this shift means there are some games that, while they may be great on a desktop PC, aren't a great experience on Steam Deck.

We want it to be easy for you to find great gaming experiences on Steam Deck, so we’ve designed a system to do just that.

Valve is reviewing the entire Steam catalog on Deck.
----------

After each game is reviewed, it is categorized for its level of compatibility of Steam Deck. You’ll see these categories on Steam, when you’re browsing your library or shopping for games on Deck.

Four categories of Deck compatibility
----------

###### Verified ######

The game works great on Steam Deck, right out of the box.

###### Playable ######

The game may require some manual tweaking by the user to play\*.

###### Unsupported ######

The game is currently not functional on Steam Deck.

###### Unknown ######

We haven't checked this game for compatibility yet.

\*E.g. requiring user to manually select a community controller config, needing to use the touchscreen to navigate a launcher, etc.

Games that check these four boxes are Deck Verified.
----------

#### Input ####

The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.

#### Display ####

The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.

#### Seamlessness ####

The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.

#### System Support ####

If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.

In your library or the store, you can see Steam Deck compatibility details for every title that has been reviewed, giving you the information you need to inform your playing and purchasing decisions.

Steam Deck compatibility review is ongoing.
----------

The Steam Deck compatibility review process is ongoing: there are tens of thousands of titles already released on Steam, and new titles and game updates publish every day. Additionally, we're constantly adding features and improvements to the Deck itself that enable previously-Unsupported games to play, and are working hard to make sure the compatibility ratings you see for your games reflect the most current information.
