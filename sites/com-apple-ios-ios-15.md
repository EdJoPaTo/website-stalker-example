iOS 15
==========

In touch.
In the moment.

iOS 15 is packed with new features that help you connect with others, be more present and in the moment, explore the world, and use powerful intelligence to do more with iPhone than ever before.

[See the preview of iOS 16](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16-preview/)

Face ID
----------

### Use Face ID with a mask ###

With iOS 15.4, you can use Face ID while wearing a mask. Easily unlock your iPhone, use Apple Pay, and authorize apps and passwords. Even when your mouth and nose are covered, your iPhone can now recognize you by analyzing the unique characteristics around your eyes.

New experiences.
True connections.
----------

Staying in touch is more essential than ever. With SharePlay, you can watch together, listen together, and share your screen right inside FaceTime. FaceTime calls also sound and feel more natural. And Messages makes it even easier to find and enjoy the great content shared from friends and family.

### FaceTime ###

#### Introducing SharePlay ####

Keep FaceTime conversations going as you watch TV shows and movies, listen to music, or share your screen. SharePlay is an entirely new way to have experiences with family and friends, no matter the distance.

#### Watch together ####

Stream movies and TV shows while on a FaceTime call with friends. With synced playback and controls, you’ll see everyone laugh, jump, and react to the same moments at the same time. And the volume automatically adjusts, so you can keep talking while you watch.

More about Watch together

#### Watch together ####

Watch your favorite videos, movies, and TV shows in sync with friends. The following apps and streaming services will support SharePlay later this year.

Disney+, Hulu, HBOmax, NBA, twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, ESPN+, Paramount+, Pluto TV

#### Listen together ####

Get together and listen to an album with friends. The whole group can see what’s next and add songs to a shared queue with synced playback and easy-to-use controls.

#### Share your screen ####

Share your screen with everyone in your FaceTime call. Browse apartment listings, swipe through a photo album, or teach someone a new skill, all while seeing and talking to one another.

#### Spatial audio ####

Individual voices sound like they’re coming from the direction in which each person is positioned on your screen, helping conversations flow more naturally.

#### Grid view ####

Grid view shows people on your FaceTime call in the same-size tiles, so you can have better conversations with a large group. The speaker is automatically highlighted so you always know who’s talking.

#### Portrait mode ####

Inspired by Portrait mode in Camera, this new video effect puts the focus on you, not what’s behind you.

#### Mic modes ####

Voice Isolation minimizes background noise and puts your voice front and center. When the music or sounds around you are as important as what you have to say, Wide Spectrum leaves the ambient sound unfiltered.

Animation of available Mic modes for FaceTime: Default, Voice Isolation, or Wide Spectrum.

More about Mic modes

#### Mic modes ####

With Voice Isolation, your mic uses machine learning to block ambient and distracting noises (like dogs barking or a TV in the next room), to make sure your voice comes through loud and clear.

Wide Spectrum lets your friends on FaceTime hear every sound happening where you are. It’s ideal for taking music lessons or for when you want someone to listen to what’s going on around you.

#### FaceTime links ####

Schedule and share FaceTime calls with a unique web link.

More about FaceTime links

#### FaceTime links ####

Make a unique FaceTime web link to easily set up a call for later or share the link with a group. Share it with your friends in Messages, Mail, or third‑party apps like WhatsApp. You can also generate a link for an event in Calendar, so everyone will know exactly where and when to meet.

#### Invite anyone to FaceTime ####

Now you can send friends and family a link to connect on FaceTime — even if they’re using Windows or Android. And it’s still end-to-end encrypted, so your call is as private and secure as any other FaceTime call.

### Messages and Memoji ###

#### Shared with You ####

Now the links, images, and other content shared with you in Messages are featured in a new Shared with You section in the corresponding app. You can even reply right from the app you’re enjoying it from — without going back to Messages.

#### Shared with You in apps ####

Shared with You is built into Photos, Safari, Apple News, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app.

#### New Memoji ####

Now you can choose outfits for your Memoji and express yourself with new stickers. Represent your look and style with multicolor headwear. And accessibility customizations now include cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.

#### Photo collections ####

Multiple photos in Messages now appear as a collage or an elegant stack of images that you can swipe through. Tap to view them all as a grid or add a quick Tapback. And save them to your library with just a few taps.

Be in the moment.
----------

A powerful new set of tools gives you more control over how you prioritize your time and attention. So you can find balance and stay focused on whatever you’re doing in the moment.

### Focus ###

#### Match your devices to your mindset ####

Focus helps you stay in the moment when you need to concentrate or step away. Choose from a list of Focus options or create your own to allow only the notifications you want — you can get work done while you’re in the zone or enjoy a distraction‑free dinner.

What do you want to focus on? Choose a focus area to set up: Custom. Driving. Excerising. Gaming. Reading.

#### Signal your status ####

Stepping away is easier if others know you’re busy. So when you’re using Focus, your status will be automatically displayed in Messages and other communication apps you allow. And for truly urgent messages, there’s still a way for people to notify you.

### Notifications ###

#### Redesigned notifications ####

Notifications have a new look, including contact photos and larger app icons to make them easier to identify.

#### Notification summary ####

Quickly catch up with a helpful collection of your notifications delivered daily, based on a schedule you set. The summary is intelligently ordered by priority, with the most relevant notifications at the top.

Brand-new ways of looking at the world.

The bottom tab bar puts controls right at your fingertips. Swipe left or right on the address bar to move between tabs. Or swipe up to see all your open tabs.

### Wallet ###

#### ID cards ####

Add your driver’s license or state ID to Wallet for use when you travel and, in the future, at retailers and venues.

More about ID cards

Starting in participating U.S. states, add your ID to Wallet for use when you travel.

Driver’s licenses and state IDs in Wallet take full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch.

#### Keys for your everyday ####

Now your iPhone can unlock your home, your hotel room, and even your workplace.

Intelligence designed to be helpful.
----------

There is so much rich information in your photos, from memorable places you’ve visited to handwritten family recipes. iOS 15 uses secure on-device intelligence to help you discover more in your photos, quickly find what you’re looking for, and relive special moments.

### Live Text ###

Live Text intelligently unlocks rich and useful information in images, so you can make a call, send an email, or look up directions with just a tap on the highlighted text in a photo.

Live Text highlights the text on screen and lets you copy, select all, look up, and share content.

Live Text understands seven different languages: English, Chinese, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. And with system‑wide translation, you can simply tap and translate.

[Learn more about the Health app](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/)

Privacy
----------

Great features should not have to come at the expense of your privacy. iOS 15 provides increased visibility into how apps access your data, protects you from unwanted data collection, and gives you more control over what you choose to share.

### App Privacy Report ###

See how apps are using the permissions you’ve granted them, which domains they contact, and how recently they made contact.

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Catch up on email with more peace of mind.

More about Mail Privacy Protection

### Mail Privacy Protection ###

Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t link it to your other online activity or determine your location. And it prevents senders from seeing if and when you’ve opened their email.

### Siri ###

Audio of your
Siri requests never leaves your device.

More about Siri

### Siri ###

Siri adds on-device speech recognition, so the audio of your requests is processed on your iPhone or iPad by default. And on-device processing also means Siri can perform many tasks without an internet connection.

iCloud+
----------

iCloud has always kept your important information — like photos, documents, and notes — safe, up to date, and accessible across all your devices. Now iCloud+ takes that experience a step further, with an all-new subscription that will replace today’s storage plans.

### Introducing iCloud+ ###

Get everything you already love about iCloud — and new features including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support.

###  iCloud Private Relay
Beta  ###

Browse the web with more privacy.

More about iCloud Private Relay Beta

###  iCloud Private Relay
Beta  ###

iCloud Private Relay is a service that lets you connect to virtually any network and browse with Safari in an even more secure and private way. It ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted and uses two separate internet relays so no one can use your IP address, location, and browsing activity to create a detailed profile about you.

### Hide My Email ###

Instantly generate unique, random email addresses that forward to your personal inbox — so you don’t have to share your real email address when filling out a form on the web or signing up for a newsletter. Hide My Email is built into Mail, Safari, and iCloud Settings.

And so much more.
----------

### Accessibility. ###

Customize display and text size settings for each app. Bold or enlarge text, increase contrast, invert colors, and more for only the apps you want. Explore people, objects, text, and tables within images in more detail with VoiceOver. Navigate receipts and nutrition label values in logical order. And move your finger over a photo to discover a person’s position relative to other objects in the image.

### Weather. ###

A fresh new look includes graphical displays of weather data and beautifully redesigned animated backgrounds — along with precipitation, air quality, and temperature maps — that make Weather more engaging and powerful than ever.

### Notes. ###

Productivity updates in Notes enable you to organize with tags and collaborate in new ways with mentions and an Activity view.

### Translate. ###

System-wide translation lets you translate text that you select, even in many third-party apps. In the app, Auto Translate and face to face view improve conversation flow and make it easier to follow along.

### Widgets. ###

Enjoy all-new widgets for Find My, Game Center, App Store, Sleep, Mail, and Contacts.

### Find My. ###

See your family’s and friends’ locations with continuous updates. Locate your devices using the Find My network if they’ve been erased, or for up to 24 hours even after they’ve been turned off.

### Apple ID. ###

Account Recovery Contacts makes resetting your password and maintaining access to your account easier than ever. And a new Digital Legacy program lets you designate people as Legacy Contacts so they can access your account in the event of your death.

### Siri. ###

You can now ask Siri to share items onscreen like photos, web pages, news, and more. If the item can’t be shared, Siri will offer to send a screenshot instead.
